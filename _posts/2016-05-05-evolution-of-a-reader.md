I wasn't a voracious reader as a child. I was rambunctious and had approximately no desire to make myself sit still long enough to get through a book. That's not to say that I didn't read anything. I did, just not as much as people assume when they hear that I'm a children's bookseller. What I did have a desire for was telling stories. Rather than sitting and reading, I was more likely to be found outside making up some elaborate story for why we were wearing bed sheets in the backyard and then getting loudly upset when someone didn't follow the story that I had so meticulously created.&nbsp;

As I reached an age where telling elaborate stories ceased to be cute, I realized that I wasn't really great with people. I think it was around this same time that I developed a dislike for being outside.

For a while I turned to drawing as my indoor activity of choice. My mum is an amazing artist and who doesn't want to be like their mum? And I could draw terrible pictures of my elaborate scenes! While staying inside! The problem with this, of course, was that one of my sisters was significantly better at art than me. That would not do.

When I was in third grade my family moved and I manged to find friends who also liked to do indoor things. We watched movies and made up insane scenarios and games that we could enact inside. These friends were perfect (I mean, they still are). I still got to make up my weirdly intricate stories but now I had people to build them with. We worked off of each other; in a lot of ways I think they were my first critique partners.
<br>
<br>It wasn't until middle school that I really discovered reading and realized that maybe writing was the way for me to tell stories.

It started in sixth grade, when we had to write and illustrate books to read to kindergartners for Halloween.

<br>I didn't do particularly well on that assignment.
<br>
<br>But then I discovered&nbsp;[my first Tamora Pierce book](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780590554091), which hit me like a punch to the chest. I realized that I wanted to make other people feel the way that I did when I read that book. Even now, many years later, I'm on a quest to find more books that make me feel that way and to write books that do that to someone else. What I've discovered in my travels is that the stories that have that effect are often found in children's books.
<br>
<br>I am always looking to change and evolve. I want to be better - a stronger writer, a more patient person, more clever, more concise - and the characters in children's books are always changing. Characters in children's books are constantly on the verge of becoming something else. I want to always feel on the verge of being something new. They question everything and analyze everything they do in a way that I think &nbsp;many adults pretend that they don't. I never want to grow out of that. I want to always examine why I do what I do. I want to be aware of myself in the world in a way that children's books almost always acknowledge.
<br>
<br>I didn't come into reading really young but I did come into it when I needed it the most. When the stories in my head needed a new outlet. When I started to realize that social interactions didn't feed me the way that they did a lot of other people but that stories filled me to my brim.
