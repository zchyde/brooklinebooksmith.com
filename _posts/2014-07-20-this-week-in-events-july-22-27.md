When her dead, waterlogged body is found at  the local lake, the Lee family falls apart. James, consumed by guilt, Marilyn,  bent on revenge, Nathan, certain neighborhood bad boy Jack is involved, and  Hannah, the youngest, who realizes things the others do not. As loss and grief  intertwine, dragging the family down, Ng writes with a merciless beauty,  portraying humanity at its most vulnerable. Here's a review from <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2014/07/01/book-review-everything-never-told-you-celeste/NegiY6oApUZG71YIRq6olM/story.html" target="_blank">The Boston Globe.</a>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <em>Wise Latinas: Writers on Higher Education</em>, Jennifer de Leon  has put together an anthology of essays representing the Latina experience in  academia. The essays range from dealing with traditional cultural expectations,  to navigating the gap between American and Latina cultures, to embracing the  change that college inevitably invokes. de Leon provides a platform for Latina  writers to share their personal experiences in this rich collection. Here's a great review from <a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jennifer-de-leon/wise-latinas/" target="_blank">Kirkus</a>.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Thursday, July 24 at 7pm</div><div>FICTION and MEMOIR</div><div><strong>Edan Lepucki and Joanna Rakoff</strong></div><div><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/event/edan-lepucki-and-joanna-rakoff" target="_blank"><em>California </em>and<em> My Salinger Year</em></a> </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dan Chaon calls Edan Lepucki’s <em>California</em> “a wholly original  take on the postapocalypse genre,” and he is so, so right. Cal and Frida, living  in a shack in the wilderness after the apocalypse has wiped away the only world  they have ever known, survive by seeking solace through the other. Their  life—hard but their own—is turned upside down when Frida discovers she is  pregnant. Unsure of their ability to raise a child in the wilderness, the couple  seek out the nearest settlement, finding themselves in a guarded and paranoid  community—one that provides ostensible security but has dangers of its own. Does this book sound familiar? S<a href="http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/t1nxwu/amazon-vs--hachette---sherman-alexie" target="_blank">tephen Colbert</a> has taken this book under his wing, and it's the current pick for <a href="http://reblogbookclub.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Reblog Book Club</a>, Tumblr's official book club.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Joanna Rakoff’s <em>My Salinger Year</em>, she recounts the year she  spent as an assistant at J.D. Salinger’s literary agency, contemplating her  dreams to become a poet. In this love letter to books, youth, and New York, she  writes of romance and realism, of learning how to come into her own as well as  figuring out who she wants to be and navigating the world on her own terms.
