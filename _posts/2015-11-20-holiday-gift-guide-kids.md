### PICTURE BOOKS (ages 4-8)

![9781452125329](http://images.brooklinebooksmith.com/9781452125329.jpg)**INTERSTELLAR CINDERELLA** by Deborah Underwood, illustrated by Meg Hunt [**(buy)**](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781452125329)

This spirited retelling retains Cinderella’s classic structure, but capable mechanic Cinderella meets the prince when she repairs his spaceship, and she loses a wrench instead of a glass slipper. The illustrations swirl and sparkle through the cosmos. Read-aloud friendly rhyming text carries everyone to a happy ending: Interstellar Cinderella is too young for marriage, but she’s old enough to be the royal chief mechanic! A great fit for fans of princesses and Rosie Revere, Engineer.

![9781568462554](http://images.brooklinebooksmith.com/9781568462554.jpg)**SING A SEASON SONG** by Jane Yolen and illustrated by Liesl Ashlock [**(buy)**](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781568462554)

Jane Yolen’s quiet lullaby, set to the rhythm of the changing seasons, explodes into brilliant full color in Ashlock’s sharply detailed illustrations. As plants and animals of the woods and fields traverse the year, you can also catch glimpses of a few far-off children—the natural world is always close by, if you’re willing to look. The story starts and ends in snug and sleepy winter, while vibrant images of summer will be especially welcome on cold nights.

Sometimes, if we stop and listen, our friends can give us the best advice. With gentle watercolor illustrations and whimsical characters, Muth perfectly captures quiet moments of friendship, and reminds us that rushing won’t get us as far as we think, and perseverance can lead us through even seemingly insurmountable tasks.

What could be better than a book that TRANSFORMS?! Into a ROBOT no less?! Rubin and Salmieri really hit it out of the park with this one! A wickedly clever (make sure you read all the fine print and details!) robot romp that captures the heart of the imagination and proves that we are still kids at heart. After all, who could be too old for cardboard robots?

---

Yet another beautiful installment in Joyce’s Guardians of Childhood series. To keep the lonely cold inside him from taking over Jack spreads it to the landscape instead until one day he learns that bringing joy to others is another way to keep himself warm. Jack Frost is a gorgeously illustrated look at the power of helping others and the bravery that it sometimes takes.

&nbsp;

![](/uploads/versions/9781481432320---x----283-400x---.jpg)**THE NEST** by Kenneth Oppel, illustrated by Jon Klassen [**(buy)**](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781481432320)

Anxiety-ridden Steve can hardly stand to think about his sick newborn brother. Then a white wasp comes to Steve in a dream with an offer: let this little brother go. The wasps will make a new one. A better one. He only has to say yes. Klassen’s illustrations augment the papery creepiness of the story (chapter headings are marked by a growing swarm of wasps), but it’s the courage and love bursting from this book that make it a staff favorite.

![](/uploads/versions/9780545812542---x----267-400x---.jpg)**GEORGE** by Alex Gino [**(buy)**](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780545812542)

George is a pretty normal fourth-grade girl. She likes clothes and friends. She’s dying to be Charlotte in her class production of *Charlotte’s Web*. The only thing that’s different about George is that no one knows she’s a girl. Not her teachers, her family, or her friends. But George wants that to change. Alex Gino’s debut stars a strong-minded, good-hearted, totally believable protagonist, a transgender girl who’s ready to be seen by the world as she sees herself.

![](/uploads/versions/9780062320940---x----269-400x---.jpg)**THE DOLDRUMS** by Nicholas Gannon [**(buy)**](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062320940)

A unique and whimsical story that is just begging to be read out loud. Characters reminiscent of Roald Dahl, with quirky humor and the best round about logic.

The author also created stunning full color illustrations that perfectly highlight the setting of this brilliant new classic.

---

![](/uploads/versions/9781481419420---x----265-400x---.jpg)**THE WOLF WILDER** by Katherine Rundell [**(buy)**](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781481419420)

After all, “wolves, like children, are not born to lead calm lives.”

*Marvels* opens with the lone survivor of a shipwreck, a story told in Selznick’s beautiful illustrations, and fans out into the text story of a runaway almost 200 years later. Both stories are beautiful and intriguing and meet in a way the reader won’t expect. *Marvels* is a stunning follow up to 2011’s Wonderstruck that is hands-down worth every second of the wait.

Riordan has without a doubt done it again! With his signature wit and understanding of his audience, he crafts the punny, brave, and hilarious story of runaway, Magnus Chase, who had just been informed that he is the son of a Norse God. With a story set in Boston and chapter titles that are laugh-out-loud funny on their own, *Sword of Summer* is sure to make Riordan new fans while still managing to bring the old ones back for more.

Sierra Santiago never knew magic was part of her Puerto Rican heritage.

Sierra and a young shadowshaper named Robbie race through Brooklyn against time, zombies, and worse—before they lose shadowshaping forever. With language that sings and a story that pelts across the pages, Older’s urban fantasy will go straight to your head.

It’s not easy being the fat daughter of Miss Teen Blue Bonnet 1997, but Willowdean is more interested in Dolly Parton, her best friend El, and the gorgeous boy at work than pageants. When her aunt dies and her friendship with El gets shaky, Willowdean loses confidence. To get back her gumption, she and a group of fellow unlikelys decide to compete in the pageant as they are—because every girl is good enough. Dumplin’ is funny, fierce, romantic YA at its best.
