I came to my desk this morning and there, between the wrist pad and the keyboard, lay one bobby pin; plain, brown, and totally set on not giving up any information.  How do you interrogate a bobby pin, you ask?  You should've seen me.<br /><br /><div><div>He was bent, not too hard, this way, then that way.  I roughed him up a bit, tapping him, very gently, against the edge of my desk.  I held him upside down.<br /><br />What's his age? Whether he's worked with straight or curly?<br />Wavy?<br /><br /></div><div>Was it a coworker of mine, who left him there?  Mark?  Bruno?  Eric?<br />Liz T?<br /><br />Was it an outside actor?<br />A circus actor?<br /><br />Nothing.  Silent.<br />I was left with much respect.  For him, not myself.<br /><br /><br />This all had little or nothing to do with bookselling.  The rest of the day is about that.  This is about the mysterious drama that even a Monday morning in the Booksmith, not yet open and empty of customers, in the second week before Christmas, can bring.</div></div>
