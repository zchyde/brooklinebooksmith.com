*[Olio](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781940696201)* by Tyehimba Jess ([Wave Books](http://www.wavepoetry.com/)) is a poetic tribute to African-American performance artists from the Civil War to World War I. Since most of their performances were never recorded, this collection gives life to those voices we cannot hear today.&nbsp;

In an interview with Laura Swearingen-Steadwell Jess discussed how African-American history is often misrepresented in literature:

> "The thing about black history in particular is it’s been distorted and whitewashed in so many different ways, and I do not want to be a part of that process. So to the best of my ability I try to get an accurate fix on what happened. Then I work between the lines: between what happened, and the idea of what happened."

&nbsp;

*Olio*&nbsp;works outside of the box in an attempt to accurately portray that often misrepresented history. Jess chooses to tell his artists' stories by seamlessly blending biographical facts with syncopated sonnets. And, he chooses to make Olio an interactive experience.

Perforated outsized pages can be removed to create new poems. &nbsp;They can be made into cylindrical shapes and M&ouml;bius strips that allow for the same poem to be read many different ways – reminiscent of the way African-American artists reinvent their traditions and advance their narrative.

Tyehimba Jess does not mince words and the collection is often as blunt as it is poetic. Each page brings back to life the dozens of performers that were previously lost to a whitewashed history.

Hanif Willis-Abdurraqi of&nbsp;[*The Rumpus*](http://therumpus.net/) found Jess' method to be successful in reinventing black stories as they were always meant to be told-

> "What becomes clear in the reading of this book is that Jess, though an author who has a voice that cannot be mistaken, acts more as a gentle tour guide through a period of black artistry that is often represented differently than it is here…In walking away from reading Olio, history has been reclaimed and redefined. It is, beyond a book of poems, an encyclopedia of black stories, told as we most want to see them told."
