![](/uploads/versions/chamberaward---x----526-500x---.jpg)Booksmith was honored to be named the Small Business of the Year award by the [Brookline Chamber of Commerce](http://www.brooklinechamber.com/), and co-owner Peter was pumped to accept the trophy from none other than Robert Kraft. In appreciation, Peter offered to fill in at quarterback in the Patriot's next home game, but it turns out that all hands are on deck in that position after all.
<br>Too bad for the Pats!

<br>[Lena Dunham](http://bookweb.org/open-letter-lena-dunham) penned this love letter/call to action for the American Booksellers Association [Indies First Day](http://bookweb.org/indies-first-2016). Thanks Lena! November 26th will be a day of celebration and *hard work* at independent bookstores across the country, with authors volunteering their passion and expertise on the front lines with booksellers.
<br>
<br>And down in Nashville, TN, we can feel the love coming out of [Parnassus Books](https://parnassusmusing.net/2016/09/15/book-people-are-the-best-people-how-100-authors-and-illustrators-rose-to-the-occasion-in-a-big-way/), as booksellers, authors, and illustrators have joined forces to help one bookseller through her battle with cancer. The quirky little idea of selling piggy banks painted by luminaries of the literary world has grown into something a lot bigger. Ann Patchett, co-owner of Parnassus, says that part of the proceeds will now go to the [Book Industry Charitable (Binc) Foundation](http://www.bincfoundation.org/), a non-profit dedicated to assisting booksellers in need.

<br>Watch this video for the soon-to-be-unveiled [book train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw1-M8BS4BM)at the New York Public Library. When it goes into that first tunnel, [does it spark a memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLVZqZfebj0) of another little trolley? That train brings to mind a couple ideas for Booksmith that I've come up with over the years. I've always wanted to build a glass column in the center of the store, extending up through the roof and down into the Used Book Cellar - a terrarium, about five feet in diameter, housing all manner of reptiles, amphibians, insects, and fish. Not for any good reason, just to be there. Another idea is that each and every section of the store would get it's own uniquely shaped paper lantern, each controlled by a big old-fashioned switchboard at the front desk, so that when we are telling customers where to go we can just flip the right switch.
<br>
<br>One great idea that is actually going to be coming true over the course of the next month is the opening of the **Stairwell Gallery** at Brookline Booksmith, which will turn our staircase into an art space, showcasing the amazing work of artists in and around Brookline and Boston. You will definitely be hearing and seeing more about this as the date gets closer.
<br>
<br>Thanks for reading,
