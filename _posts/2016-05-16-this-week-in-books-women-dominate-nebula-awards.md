Women writers came close to sweeping the Nebula Awards for outstanding sci-fi/fantasy writing published in 2015, presented this past weekend (fittingly, the men who *did* receive an award were George Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris, who took home the **Ray Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation** for their screenplay *Mad Max: Fury Road*, [widely](https://nypost.com/2015/05/14/why-mad-max-fury-road-is-the-feminist-picture-of-the-year/) [hailed](https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/20/8620229/mad-max-fury-road-anti-feminist-mens-rights-boycott) [as](https://www.hitfix.com/harpy/7-ways-mad-max-fury-road-sublimely-subverts-movie-sexism) [a](https://www.buzzfeed.com/lauriepenny/the-fast-and-the-feminist?utm_term=.jezMv76Gm#.iiok92zm4) [feminist](https://www.themarysue.com/george-miller-feminist-answer-franchise/) [magnum](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/27/sexists-are-scared-of-mad-max-because-it-is-a-call-to-dismantle-patriarchies) [opus](https://www.gender-focus.com/2015/05/26/who-killed-the-world-the-complicated-feminism-of-mad-max-fury-road/).) The winners, which are selected by the [Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America](https://www.sfwa.org/), stand in stark contrast to [the shortlist for this year's Hugo Awards](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/26/hugo-awards-shortlist-rightwing-campaign-sad-rabid-puppies): this other major sci-fi/fantasy literary prize's ballot system was hijacked for the second year running by right-wing factions who [protest the rising prominence](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/04/the-culture-wars-come-to-sci-fi/390012/) of women, queer writers, and writers of color within the genre.

**Best Novel**: *[Uprooted](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780804179058)* by [Naomi Novik](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/author/%22Novik%2C%20Naomi%22) (whom we [LOVE](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/2015/07/27/alex-is-readinguprooted/))

*Agnieszka loves her valley home, her quiet village, the forests and the bright shining river. But the corrupted Wood stands on the border, full of malevolent power, and its shadow lies over her life. Her people rely on the cold, driven wizard known only as the Dragon to keep its powers at bay. But he demands a terrible price for his help: one young woman handed over to serve him for ten years, a fate almost as terrible as falling to the Wood.*

*The next choosing is fast approaching, and Agnieszka is afraid. She knows "everyone" knows that the Dragon will take Kasia: beautiful, graceful, brave Kasia, all the things Agnieszka isn't, and her dearest friend in the world. And there is no way to save her. But Agnieszka fears the wrong things. For when the Dragon comes, it is not Kasia he will choose.*

*Her name is Binti, and she is the first of the Himba people ever to be offered a place at Oomza University, the finest institution of higher learning in the galaxy. But to accept the offer will mean giving up her place in her family to travel between the stars among strangers who do not share her ways or respect her customs.*

*Knowledge comes at a cost, one that Binti is willing to pay, but her journey will not be easy. The world she seeks to enter has long warred with the Meduse, an alien race that has become the stuff of nightmares. Oomza University has wronged the Meduse, and Binti's stellar travel will bring her within their deadly reach.nIf Binti hopes to survive the legacy of a war not of her making, she will need both the the gifts of her people and the wisdom enshrined within the University, itself but first she has to make it there, alive.*

"The needle on the veggie oil tank read flat empty by the time we came to China Grove. A giant pink and purple fiberglass dragon loomed over the entrance, refugee from some shuttered local amusement park, no doubt; it looked more medieval than Chinese.
