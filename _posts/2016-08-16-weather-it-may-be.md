Have you heard about NOAA’s advances in predicting the weather, informing the public about severe weather events, and their newer climate change data?&nbsp; Recently, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has made some major upgrades to their weather predicting programs. &nbsp;In May, NOAA transferred to 4-D ensemble hybrid data assimilation, which “takes into account how weather systems evolve on a 3-D spatial grid over time, with time now becoming the fourth dimension.” ([NOAA](http://www.noaa.gov/noaa%E2%80%99s-premier-forecast-model-goes-four-dimensional)). The current Global Forecast System operates about 4 times each day and predicts weather 16 days ahead; the new GFS model will distribute hourly forecast guidance out to five days, not just every three hours as it does now.&nbsp; NOAA’s weather and climate models are free and [available](http://www.nnvl.noaa.gov/weatherview/index.html) to the public.

Here are some great books that will help you understand the weather.&nbsp;
