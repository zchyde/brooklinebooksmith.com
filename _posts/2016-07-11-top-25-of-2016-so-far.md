Our new Top 25 list includes the bestselling books from January through June of this year. New to the list include Pulitzer-prize winner&nbsp;*The Sympathizer*by Viet Thanh Nguyen (customer told me she hadn't found a book that engaged her in this way since *All the Light We Cannot See* by Anthony Doerr), Paul Kalanithi's stunning and, sadly, one and only book,*When Breath Becomes Air*.&nbsp;&nbsp;*Man Called Ove* had one of those second lives that surprises and pleases and can only mean word-of-mouth buzz.&nbsp;

Other things we learned about our readers - you like your coloring books portable, and prefer the book to the film, and like your wit and wisdom in exquisitely designed pocket hardcovers. You don't get intimidated by page counts - you even loved&nbsp;*Hamilton the Musical&nbsp;*enough to read the 800+ page biography that inspired the Broadway hit. And most of all you love our locals.
