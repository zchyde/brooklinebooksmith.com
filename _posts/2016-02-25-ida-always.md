Grief is perhaps the most difficult emotion of all to explain. One of the hardest tasks a parent or guardian faces is explaining grief to a child.

This week, a beautiful picture book landed in our store and brought tears to our eyes.

[ida, Always by Carson Levis and Charles Santoso](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781481426404)

---

*Ida, Always*is inspired by [the true story](https://gothamist.com/2013/08/28/gus_the_central_park_zoo_polar_bear.php#photo-1) of Gus and Ida, two polar bears who lived in the Central Park Zoo. In the book, Gus and Ida are the best of friends; they play together, eat together, and listen to the surrounding city's heartbeat together. But one day Ida gets sick and Gus is told there is no cure. Gus knows that their days together are never going to be the same, but the two friends make the best of it. They have good days, and bad days, and days where they don't quite know what they are feeling. Gus and Ida fumble through their shared grief in a beautiful, and very real way.

[Levis](https://www.caronlevis.com/) and [Santoso](https://www.charlessantoso.com/) have managed, through few words and soft images, to depict the range of emotion that grief brings to us.  Even knowing the inevitable ending, I felt hope and love while reading this story. It is certainly a tearjerker, but I think it might be one of the best children's books about grief I have ever read.
