Whew! We have been bustling this week! School is closing in on our students, and there’s still time for some last-minute vacation reading on top of those assigned books (which, by the way, you can still find at the back of the kids’ department). Meanwhile, in the book world, FALL is closing in. Fall is book season in the same way that fall is apple season–you can get new and delicious books all year around, but when fall arrives, the books come out in bushels. I have definitely caught the first hints of autumn air on my walks to work this week–and in the store, it’s getting harder to pickwhich amazing new release to talk about first.

Aside from *[Percy Jackson’s Greek Heroes](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781423183655)* and *[The Day the Crayons Came Home](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780399172755)*, here are a few more (okay, more than a few) titles that have come out in the last month or so that we are delighted to share with you.

**Clarissa’s Picks:**

[*Baba Yaga’s Assistant*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763669614) is a witchy, folk lore-ish graphic novel by Marika McCoola, with art by Emily Carroll of [*Into the Woods*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781442465961). In this graphic novel a girl named Masha does the unlikely–instead of keeping out of notorious witch Baba Yaga’s way, she figures out how to become her apprentice. It’s a great new take on Russian folklore if you’ve heard the stories before, and a great introduction if you haven’t.

*[Court of Fives](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316364195)* is fantasy writer Kate Elliott’s first young adult novel. High-stakes sports in an otherworldly setting mix with the complex and inescapable forces of class and race in a dense but pacy fantasy with a heroine you will love.

**Amy’s Picks:**

Moira Fowley-Doyle’s [*The Accident Season*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780525429487) is a YA novel about secrets, family, and one family in particular that, each October, suffers violently bad luck. If you like[Holly Black](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/site/holly%20black), or Diana Wynne Jones’s Time of the Ghost (unforgivably out of print), this book should be very much up your alley.

[*Made You Up*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062290106) by Francesca Zappia is about Alex, a girl whose schizophrenia gives her delusions that she can’t always separate from reality. It’s manageable, until she meets a boy named Miles. Miles starts to change Alex’s ideas about what kind of life she’s allowed to live–the question is, did Alex make him up?

**Alex’s Picks:**

I have been waiting MONTHS for Alex Gino’s [*George*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780545812542). It’s a middle grade novel, accessible, heartfelt, and with wonderfully real fourth-grade voices, about a transgender girl named George. She’s still figuring herself out and hasn’t come out to her family when the book begins, but George wants to live as the glorious girl that she is. It will just take a little planning. Great for fans of [Wonder](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780375869020) or [Fish in a Tree](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780399162596).

[The Sky Is Falling](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780545632171) by Mark Teague is the story of Chicken Little, but with way more dancing. Can chickens outsmart a fox with their smooth moves? Well, if you have read James Marshall’s wonderful [Wings](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780618316595), you know a chicken can do anything she sets her mind to.

**The last books up there are officially multi-bookseller picks:**

Amy has read Stephanie Tromly’s [*Trouble Is a Friend of Mine*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780525428404)THREE TIMES. I have read it once. (I haven’t given Amy her book back. Yet. Yet!) Zoe has new girl problems–and then she has Digby, the obnoxious, obsessive, voracious food-thief who suddenly wants her to break all kinds of laws to solve one or two missing persons cases. It’s a quick read that will happily blindside anyone who loves Sherlock Holmes, but also kind of wants to give him a punch in the nose.

*Fina**\*\*lly*, a new and terrifying YA horror anthology: [*Slasher Girls and Monster Boys*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780803741737), edited by April Genevieve Tucholke. We’ve all been passing around our staff advanced copy of this one, and I saw bookseller Kat taking her own copy home. If you’re already preparing yourself emotionally for Halloween (and I assume you are), start here. Here is a very good place to start.
