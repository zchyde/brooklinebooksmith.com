A bookseller favorite here at the Booksmith is&nbsp;*Feed&nbsp;*by Mira Grant. &nbsp;The first in a terrifying trilogy following two young journalists as they investigate the suspicious circumstances of a sudden epidemic. &nbsp;This story's real fright factor lies in the social policies and political ideologies developed as a result of the zombie outbreak.&nbsp;

[We Have Always Lived in the Castle by Shirley Jackson](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780143039976)&nbsp;

Shirley Jackson is well known for her hilarious non-fiction works but *We Have Always Lived in the Castle&nbsp;*is proof of her amazing stylistic range. &nbsp;Told through the eyes of Mary Katherine, resident of the Blackwood Estate, the story begins with a tragic and very suspicious poisoning. &nbsp;The deceptively simple story comes to a very disturbing conclusion.&nbsp;

[American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780679735779)

There is no character more deplorable than Brett Easton Ellis' Patrick Bateman. &nbsp;While Bateman lacks all empathy this story has no lack of emotional tension and gut-wrenching terror. &nbsp;

[Night Shift by Stephen King](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780307743640)

*Night Shift* is a collection of terrifying short stories by the master himself – Stephen King.&nbsp; Other titles of his like <u>The Shining</u> and <u>Pet Sematary</u> were all strong contenders but Night Shift made this list because of one story, "The Boogeyman." &nbsp;The story begins,

> "I came to you because I want to tell my story,' the man on Dr Harper's couch was saying. The man was Lester Billings from Waterbury, Connecticut. According to the history taken from Nurse Vickers, he was twenty-eight, employed by an industrial firm in New York, divorced, and the father of three children. All deceased."

[Dracula by Bram Stoker](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780451530660')

Bram Stoker's *Dracula* is a classic by all accounts and could not be left out of this list.&nbsp; Other horror classics like Mary Shelley's&nbsp;[Frankenstein](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780451532244) were considered but*Dracula* earns its spot on this list because meeting the modern Prometheus would be exciting but Dracula should definitely keep his distance.&nbsp;
