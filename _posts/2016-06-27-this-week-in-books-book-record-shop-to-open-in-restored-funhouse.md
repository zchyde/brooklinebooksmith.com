Bill "Wild Bill" Ziegler of Middletown, Connecticut (not Massachusetts, [as reported by Publisher's Weekly](https://publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/70764-bookstore-news-june-27-2016.html) - more's the pity) is slated to open a store for books, records and art inside a restored funhouse next month. With over 25,000 vinyl albums on hand, the store will be open 7 days a week, although Wild Bill (below) is [still in the process of raising $200,000](https://www.wildbillsonline.com/funhouse) to fund its completion.

The new venture will join [Wild Bill's Nostalgia](https://www.wildbillsonline.com/categories/), the proprietor's existing shop for "posters, magazines, whale bones, bobbing head dolls, pops, wacky wobblers, bones, taxidermy, flags, records, petrified turtle shell," and other miscellany; a [fairground/concert venue](https://www.wildbillsonline.com/events/); and ongoing art installations such as the [world's largest Jack-in-a-Box](https://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/19394) (in a silo) and a meadow of psychedelic half-buried boat hulls by local artist Joe McCarthy ([no relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy), as far as I can tell). Wild Bill has also [stated plans](https://www.middletownpress.com/business/20150727/lovingly-crafted-mini-amusement-park-in-middletown-waiting-on-funds) to install a miniature golf course, batting cages, and a family entertainment center.
