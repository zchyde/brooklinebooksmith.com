![](/uploads/versions/paul_autograph_compress---x----831-793x---.jpg)Nobody can deny that it's neat to see a celebrity shopping in the same place where you shop. Like when you see Tom Brady buying yet another four-phones-for-the-price-of-one plan at the cell phone store, or when you find out Mayor Walsh gets his cargo shorts hemmed by the same guy you do, or like last year when (and this one's true) Gloria Estefan did all her holiday shopping right here in our own Giftsmith. But we're proud book nerds, so yesterday's sighting (well, hearing) beat out all of those, when a bookseller took a call from one of our favorites authors, [Mac Barnett](http://www.macbarnett.com/books/), who wanted to send one of our tote bags to a friend. Right now there's some Brady or Bust die-hard out there laughing at us for saying this, but &nbsp;it doesn't get better than that.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Now, it's fair to ask if we are featuring pictures of Mac Barnett's books as some kind of reward for him calling our store.&nbsp;
<br>Is this like some kind of dirty political pay-to-play kind of situation?&nbsp;
<br>Absolutely. Authors take note.
<br>
<br>Now, if all that celebrity worship left a bad taste in your mouth, here's a soulful palate cleanser. Watch this&nbsp;[short video](https://vimeo.com/85667492)&nbsp;which expresses all that writing, reading, and community can do.&nbsp;
<br>Here in our own community, Brookline Booksmith is honored to be named "Best Small Business" by the Brookline Chamber of Commerce. We will be presented with the award by Robert Kraft onstage at the Coolidge Corner Theater at the Brookline Chamber's "Breakfast of Champions" on Thursday, 9/22, 7:30 - 10am. Tickets for the event and more info can be found&nbsp;[here](http://www.brooklinechamber.com/). Come cheer for us!&nbsp;

<br>I was trying this whole time to find some clever way to sneak a SPOILER ALERT! into this intro, but since I failed, let me*&nbsp;end&nbsp;*with one. Extra super bonus points to Jonathan Russell Clark, author of this [essay in LitHub](http://lithub.com/spoiler-alerts-any-story-worth-telling-doesnt-need-them/), for pairing Paul Murray's&nbsp;[Skippy Dies](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780865478619)&nbsp;with Shakespeare's&nbsp;*Romeo & Juliet*&nbsp;in his examination of spoilers on the page and screen.
<br>
<br>We were saddened to hear of the passing of&nbsp;[Anna Dewdney](http://publishersweekly.tumblr.com/post/150056066571/childrens-author-illustrator-and-educator-anna), author of the beloved Llama Llama picture books. Far, far too soon.
<br>
<br>Thanks for reading,
