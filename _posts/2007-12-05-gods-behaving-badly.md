I've been waiting for this to arrive so I can start recommending it, and it's finally here! What I love most about it is that it's a book written for intelligent people but it don't take itself or its readership too seriously--saying this book was enjoyable is not to damn it with faint praise but to note how rare it is to find a book that lightens your mood while giving you a good story.</div><br /><div></div><div>I'm glad to see that it's a December <a href="http://www.booksense.com/">Book Sense </a>pick, and this is how Barbara Hoagland, from <a href="http://kingsenglish.booksense.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp">The King's English </a>in Salt Lake City, UT summarized the plot: "The gods of Greek mythology are living together in a shabby house in London: Aphrodite's a phone-sex operator, Apollo is a TV psychic, Artemis is a dog-walker, and Zeus is suffering from dementia. Things have definitely gone downhill for the former inhabitants of Olympus. It takes a couple of mortals to bring the gods back to fighting form in this funny, most unusual novel." </div><br /><div></div><div>By the way: I think I've mentioned before my love for <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780786838653">Percy Jackson </a>novels; I have to admit that more than once while reading Gods Behaving Badly I thought "this is great--it's like Percy Jackson for adults!" So if you've been stealing your kids' Percy Jackson novels, definitely give this a try. </div>
