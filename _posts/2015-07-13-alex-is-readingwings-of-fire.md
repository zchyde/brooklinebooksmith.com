<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">WHEW. This last Thursday's event with Chris Colfer and his fourth <i>Land of Stories</i> book was a huge success! I was told by one fan that it was "the best book signing [they'd] ever been to," and from up at the register and outside with the loooooooong line, I saw so many glowingly happy faces. This kind of hectic day really is one of my favorite things about the job.<br /><br />Our next kids' event is coming right up! Tui Sutherland, (local!) author of the <i><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780545349239">Wings of Fire</a></i> series, will be with us on the NINETEENTH OF JULY AT 2PM. The seventh book of the series, <i><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780545685375">WINTER TURNING</a></i>, has just come out, and it is time to celebrate!<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/wingsoffire/images/5/50/Wiki-background/revision/latest?cb=20150115221554" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/wingsoffire/images/5/50/Wiki-background/revision/latest?cb=20150115221554" height="166" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;">(Look at this awesome cover art. LOOK.)</div><br /><br />If you haven't read <i>Wings of Fire</i> already, it is not too late to start. They are quick-paced, action-packed dragon adventures, featuring warring tribes, peril, and cool dragon powers. The main characters are a growing cast of slightly unusual dragonets (young dragons, of course!)--starting with five dragonets from different groups, who have been raised in isolation with the hopes that they will fulfill a prophecy to end the war. But while they do want the war to end, they quickly discover they are not so interested in acting on the orders of any adult dragon they meet. Instead they set off to fix things in their own way--if only they can keep from being killed in the process.<br /><br />In short: this series is dragon <i>Game of Thrones</i> for kids (9+ is the recommended age), and it is awesome.<br /><br />If you <i>have</i> read the whole series, and you are looking for something to feed your reading appetites when the last page is finished, here are a few more books you might check out until, some day in the hopefully not too distant future, <i>Wings of Fire</i> <i>eight</i> comes out.<br /><br /><b>IN THE MEANTIME, top three: </b><br /><br /><i><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316038638">Where the Mountain Meets the Moon</a></i> by Grace Lin -- In a fantasy landscape based on China and Chinese mythology, a young girl travels through legend and story in the company of a dragon to make her poor family's fortune.<br /><br /><i><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780064402279">Dragon of the Lost Sea</a> </i>by Lawrence Yep -- An evil witch has trapped the sea in which dragon princess Shimmer and her people live inside a single pearl.
