Yesterday I was watching the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Tyra</span> Banks show (I know I know...don't judge) where she had Eve <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ensler</span> on to push her new book "I am an Emotional Creature". <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Tyra</span> asked her her usual mind-bogglingly poignant questions...but once we got through that and Eve was allowed to speak I learned that<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/S3bW62tuGmI/AAAAAAAAABY/dWiIGL4djXw/s1600-h/eve+ensler.jpg"><img style="MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; WIDTH: 240px; FLOAT: left; HEIGHT: 240px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5437769906704489058" border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/S3bW62tuGmI/AAAAAAAAABY/dWiIGL4djXw/s320/eve+ensler.jpg" /></a> Barbie was originally designed as a sex toy for men, and that up until 12 years ago one could not use the word "vagina" on television.<br /><br />Then Eve went on to discuss her "free Barbie" project...a story she wrote where all the Barbies of the world can broadcast the thoughts of one forward-thinking little girl, who then mobilizes the troops towards a new feminism. I stopped what I was doing when I heard this, (because surprisingly enough I can do several other things while watching <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Tyra</span>...) and had a little <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">deja</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">vu</span><br /><br />Last week I finished reading Denise <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Duhamel's</span> collection of poetry entitled "Kinky". It's a collection of poems about Barbie. This book is incredible in that it manages to be funny, historically accurate, engaging, challenging and magnetic.It also has a mental shelf life, because I have still been processing some of the poems. Yet, I cannot emphasize enough just how similar what Eve had to say about the doll was to what many of Denise's poems were saying about the doll. Now herein lies the itch I have...Eve <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ensler</span> is a well educated feminist...and I guess I am wondering If she was aware of Denise <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">Duhamel's</span> work...<br />What responsibility do artists and <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">edi</span><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/S3bW6oqCA4I/AAAAAAAAABQ/kUCBHaUv4Mo/s1600-h/kinky.jpg"><img style="MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; WIDTH: 154px; FLOAT: left; HEIGHT: 240px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5437769902930920322" border="0" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/S3bW6oqCA4I/AAAAAAAAABQ/kUCBHaUv4Mo/s320/kinky.jpg" /></a>tors have to the great "conversation" of <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-error">intertextuality</span>?<br /><br />One exciting thing that the e-reading offers, is the opportunity to hyperlink, within the text , to other texts. (Some authors link to the dictionary which is helpful when reading D.F. Wallace for example) I posture, that it could open the doors to a more fluid referential reading community, one wherein everyone is invited to the party, everyone is in on the joke....and if you see no hypertext...that too can signify a certain something...<br /><br />Joe <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-error">Amato</span>, writes poetry that hyperlinks to other parts of his own poems -making his work fluid and mobile. I think we are going to see a lot more artists using this tool in their prosody.<br /><br />For now, and until then, I'll hold authors responsible to do their homework. While watching <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-error">Tyra</span>.
