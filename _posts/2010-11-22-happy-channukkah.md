The Festival of Lights, Latkes, and Infinite Spellings starts on December 1 this year. That's soon, friends. Leftover-turkey soon.<br /><br />We in the kids' section are ready. We've got our favorite gift recommendations organized by age. We've got heads and shelves full of other suggestions on every topic and in every genre. And if you're looking for something that introduces, honors, or even kibitzes the holiday itself, look no further.<br /><br />You know how Eric Carle's <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> has it all? Counting, bright colors, and even holes in the pages for curious little fingers? Emily Sper's <i>Hanukkah: A Counting Book</i> has all that, too, and some Hebrew and Yiddish for good measure. It's basic enough and eye-catching enough to appeal to the youngest readers, and it's also a good introduction for kids of any age who haven't experienced the holiday themselves. The same goes for <i>Hanukkah, Oh, Hanukkah</i>, by Susan Roth, with its singable text and its colorful mice and dreydels.<br /><br />For readers who've been there and spun that, we have some irreverent offerings. In <i>Hershel and the Hanukkah Goblins</i>, a visitor uses his cleverness to save a village from, dare I say it, Grinchly goblins. And I suspect that nothing needs to be said beyond this title and author: <i>The Latke Who Couldn't Stop Screaming</i>, by Lemony Snicket.<br /><br />We've got plenty more titles on hand, so come on in!
