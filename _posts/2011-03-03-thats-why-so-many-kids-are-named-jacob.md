A recent arrival in our Young Adult section has a single rose against a black background for its cover. Another has a similar design but bears two wilting tulips. The titles of these romantic teen offerings? <i>Jane Eyre</i> and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>, respectively.<br /><br />A co-worker had to explain to me that both these novels, along with a couple of others similarly redesigned by HarperTeen, are referenced in the Twilight series. Once she mentioned Twilight, it was easy to see <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316015844">what inspired</a> these <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062015624">new</a> <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062015631">covers</a>.<br /><br />BrontÃ« and Austen readers are all English majors, right? Stephanie Meyer's audience only wants brain candy, no?<br /><br />There are many reasons to like a book or to be interested in reading it. You adults slinking around the YA section needn't look so nervous. We, of all people, don't judge.
