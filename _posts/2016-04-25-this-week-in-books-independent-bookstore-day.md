Did you know this Saturday, April 30th is the second annual [Independent Bookstore Day](https://www.indiebookstoreday.com/)? Over 400 bookstores around the country are gearing up with special activities and exclusive items to celebrate the tradition of locally-run bookslingers, still going strong in the digital age.
