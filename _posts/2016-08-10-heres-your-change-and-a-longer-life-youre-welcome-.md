![](/uploads/versions/081016---x----500-513x---.jpg)I have the lucky job of coming in an hour or two before we open our doors. The play of light and shadow brings a mystery and magic to the roomful of books that hardly anyone else gets to see. Maybe we should do a sleepover party, so folks can get to know the full range of Booksmith's moods? I know how to make a fake campfire using a flashlight, a fan, and some orange and red tissue paper.

<br>Don't you love it when science comes along and confirms what you've always believed to be true? It's official: [reading makes you live longer](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/read-books-live-longer/?_r=0). And to think, all these years, we thought we were in the snake-oil business! As it turns out, what we've been peddling are actually small doses of eternity.

<br>Now, before you read on in this newsletter (which is sure to get you all hot and bothered about books, readings, lunch boxes, talent shows, unusual clocks, gymnastics, etc.), let this [set the tone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdCutpuUrX4) for the rest of your day.
<br>
<br>Here's a couple of inspiring projects you should take a look at, and maybe even chip in a few bucks to help make them come true. One campaign is to help an exciting indie [bookstore](https://riffraffpvd.squarespace.com/community-lending/) come to life in Providence, and the other is to help an unbelievably cool[book](http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2016/08/wooden-puzzle-book/)get constructed.
<br>
<br>One last thing that caught our eye this week is a certain classic series which got a radical redesign: The Pelican Shakespeare series, featuring the amazing artwork of [Manuja Waldia](http://www.manujawaldia.com/#/penguin-shakespeare/).
