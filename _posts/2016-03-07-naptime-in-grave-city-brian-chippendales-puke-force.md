I first became hip to Brian Chippendale back in 2002. I was standing in a now-defunct record store in Cambridge rifling through the new arrivals when it hit me-actually more like singed my fingertips. I was assured by the clerk that upon listening to the record, my face would melt off. Myself not being much of a looker, I took the risk. And *Ride The Skies* by the band Lightning Bolt would become a cherished fixture in my record collection.

Besides the ferocious nature of the music, I was equally captivated by the cover art. It looked like [Henry Darger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Darger) trying to create Nintendo [kill screens](http://i.imgur.com/SiHtjP1.gif). The coarse feel of the ink hinted at something handmade, unique, one of a kind. On the cover, a crowded, clouded caravan fleeing from the ruins of a mythical world [my take]. Pretty neat, I thought. I went back to the record store a week later and asked the same clerk if he knew who did the cover. “The drummer,” he said. “Brian Chippendale.”

I’ve always had a voracious appetite for comics. From my days as a rugrat, through my tempestuous career as a student, and even today, in my life of faux luxury, I consume a lot of graphic literature. The weirder the better. The same can be said about my love for music. Much of Chippendale’s work oozes a strong whiff of musicality, from the early *Ninja*series and the weighted treasure of *If ‘N Oof*, all the way up to his newest invention, *Puke Force*.

*Puke Force* centers around a team of weirdos who seek to protect Grave City from some seriously terrible monsters: social injustice, corrupt government, and personified YouTube comments. Each panel is an IV drip containing a mixture of satire and sarcasm. It is a chaotic depiction of a chaotic world - composed in the same manner as David Lynch’s *[Eraserhead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK-2_OsBe0s)*or Albert Ayler’s iconic free jazz masterpiece [*Spirits Rejoice*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-0b5Rodwsg). It looks like a giant cloud of scribbles but after awhile you begin to sense the rhythm and read along to its unique, one of a kind beat. *Puke Force* isn’t fleeing from the ruins in terror; it’s heading straight towards it with gritted teeth and clenched fists.

Brian Chippendale is a genius and you should accept this genius into your life by purchasing *Puke Force* [here](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781770462199):
