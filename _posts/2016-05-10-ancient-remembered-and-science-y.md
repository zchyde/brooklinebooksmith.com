Hi, everyone!
<br>Oh my gosh, I have so much to show you this week!&nbsp;[Eileen Pollack](http://lithub.com/why-fiction-needs-more-women-scientists/)&nbsp;on women, science, and fiction; the Book Expo America [soundtrack](https://play.spotify.com/user/craigpopelars/playlist/2jprpc4nv1lk1cLj72tTKl?play=true&amp;utm_source=open.spotify.com&amp;utm_medium=open)&nbsp;(shout out to my buddies at BEA right now!); imaginary [remembered bicycles](http://www.gianlucagimini.it/prototypes/velocipedia.html); the impossibility of living up to our lifestyle aspirations if it means [getting rid of books](http://www.gianlucagimini.it/prototypes/velocipedia.html); art from ancient [octopus ink](http://www.nrk.no/viten/maler-bilder-med-forhistorisk-blekk-1.12931408); mesmerizing&nbsp;[marbles and magnets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ9gs-5lRKc); as well as the just-breaking news of a&nbsp;[third party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP0shgq65F4&amp;index=25&amp;list=PLD7DD9B432E1C1AE3)&nbsp;candi

<br>
<br>wait, what was I saying?
<br>Did you click on that last link?
<br>They've virtually realized my personal paradise. The future is amazing, slay me now, I want to go.
<br>
<br>Speaking of the future, do you realize how long it's been around for? I'm reading the magnificently accessible&nbsp;[7 Brief Lessons on Physics](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780399184413), and discovering that pretty much everything we think we know is actually a great unresolved and undulating field of questions stemming from questions stemming from the repeated refutations of Newton's brilliant misconceptions. Even the scientists who've been studying them for about a century don't know what a quantum leap is, but they've figured out how to account for them, and that's why I can send you this newsletter.

This Saturday from 11-4, as part of the&nbsp;[Polly Thayer Starr Artist Series](http://www.gardnermuseum.org/calendar/events/7157)&nbsp;at the Gardner Museum, you are invited to drop in and create a travel-inspired mobile or travel journal with local artist and illustrator Diane Bigda. If you've ever been in the Booksmith and whiled away an hour under the whimsical tree in our children's section, then you know Diane's beautiful work. This one-of-a-kind workshop experience is free with the price of admission to the museum!
