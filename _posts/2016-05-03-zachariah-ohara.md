I may be a full-fledged adult but that doesn't mean I can't get excited about seeing a flying squirrel dressed up as a muffin. Just when I thought that no mortal being would dare disrupt the balance of the world by immeasurably tilting the cuteness-scale so heavily in one direction, I stumble upon the art of&nbsp;[Zachariah OHora](http://www.zohora.com). &nbsp;

[*My Cousin Momo*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780803740112)&nbsp;(written and illustrated entirely by OHora) centers around a flying squirrel who marches to the beat of his own drum. Rather than doing what all the other squirrels do, namely play acorn ping-pong with his cousins, he's much more interested in squirrel counterculture. He rocks a sweet vintage 35mm camera and wears a headband un-inronically. As far as squirrels go, he's fresher than farm stand produce. So do the other squirrels come to accept Momo's freshness? Do they realized how narrow their world-views are on a geo-political scale? Especially when considering that even within their own squirrel community there are over 250 different types of squirrel species? Do they eventually come to accept Momo's insatiable appetite for muffins?

Once you're done with *My Cousin Momo*, be sure to check out [*Wolfie The Bunny*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316226141) and [*Horrible Bear!*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316282833), both are illustrated by OHora and written by the equally wonderful&nbsp;[Ame Dyckman](http://www.amedyckman.com/home.html). Their books are a wonderful way to get kids thinking about big-picture issues while still maintaining a simple, and of course, totally cute style that all kids (and adults, too, for that matter) can appreciate.&nbsp;
