The creator of *10 Bears in My Bed*, [Stan](http://www.humortimes.com/36201/stan-mack-insight-cartoonists/) [Mack](http://www.stanmack.com/books.php), wrote that bedtime counting book for his son, but it's the little boy's mother who turns out the light in the final pages. "*There were ten in the bed and the little one said*…" rolls over from one generation to the next. I hear my wife and daughter sing-songing those lines through the bedroom door, and the distant memory of my mother and I doing the exact same thing make the last 30+ years seem but a moment.
<br>My mom reading to me, or waiting patiently as I tried to read each little caption on the [cat](http://kinderbooks.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/97806898449971.jpg) or [chicken](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RvZBCOlQ7sw/Td9ZpVJl3qI/AAAAAAAAGds/IxHD51rWHXw/s1600/5+maple+hill.jpg) pages of [Alice & Martin Provensen](https://fishinkblog.com/2010/10/25/alice-and-martin-provensen-vintage-childrens-illustration/)'s [Our Animal Friends at Maple Hill Farm](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780689844997).
<br>My mom, never telling me what I was supposed to be reading, even when she knew full well that I had been re-reading [The Chronicles of Narnia](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780064409421) repeatedly, exclusively, for three years straight. (the books pictured here are from when the series was numbered in the original, *correct* order: *Lion, Prince, Voyage, Silver, Horse, Magician, Last*).
<br>And [Natalie Babbit](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780312370091)'s timeless (literally - is it okay to say literally here?) Tuck Everlasting has its origins in a [tender moment](http://www.npr.org/2015/01/29/382383351/the-gift-of-eternal-shelf-life-tuck-everlasting-turns-40) of motherhood, soothing the nighttime fears of her daughter.
<br>
<br>The first week of May is [Children's Book Week](http://www.bookweekonline.com/) and Sunday is Mother's Day. As always, we have everything and more as far as beautiful gifts and thoughtful books for you to choose from, but maybe you know a mother with young kids, and you'd like to celebrate a little differently this year? A browse through the Used Book Cellar's children's section will lead you down memory lane, and yield a pile of gently worn (and gently priced) picture books. Give Mom the priceless gift of reading with her child.
<br>
<br>Before we get on with it, a handful of events notices:
<br>**The Hunger** is Anthony Bourdain's all new live show featuring an unyielding, brutally honest monologue reflecting on diverse culture, street cuisine and his travels to lesser-known locations around the world, followed by an open Q&A session. [Click here and use the promo code "HUNGER"](http://thewilbur.com/symphony-hall/) to get pre-sale tickets for the 10/7 show at The Wilbur Theatre!
<br>
<br>Closer to home, you can reserve your spot in the line for **Chuck Palahniuk's book signing** by [clicking here](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-06/chuck-palahniuk-fight-club-2/), and get your **Julian Barnes reading** tickets by [clicking here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/julian-barnes-526-tickets-24810563062).
<br>And tonight at 7pm we welcome the return of [Richard Russo](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-05/richard-russo-everybodys-fool/) to Booksmith.
<br>You don't need any tickets, but don't show up late, we expect a packed house!
<br>
<br>Next Thursday, 5/12 @ 6:45pm at the Brookline Public Library there will be a special celebration of [Grandparents and Grandchildren](http://www.brooklinelibrary.org/programs/special-events/160512-celebrate-grandparents), featuring the poetry of Margot Wizansky and Judith Steinbergh, Jan Schreiber, many more local poets, and…you? Children and teens are encouraged to bring their own poems on the theme of grandparents and grandchildren. Contact Judith at judithst@aol.com if you are a student who wishes to read.
<br>
<br>One last thing, [take a moment](http://img.ifcdn.com/images/43c0bf31c89138912ab5b35cb07bc04825f133dcbe113b52c3d4aea2b086c059_1.gif) away from everything and play around inside an interactive, almost-real-time [global map of the wind and waves](http://earth.nullschool.net/).
