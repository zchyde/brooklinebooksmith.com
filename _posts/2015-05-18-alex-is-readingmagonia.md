<div style="text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZQRYESZX-iw/VVjbFYbkfTI/AAAAAAAAAHk/hrhLXaCFo_U/s1600/magoniacover.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZQRYESZX-iw/VVjbFYbkfTI/AAAAAAAAAHk/hrhLXaCFo_U/s320/magoniacover.jpg" width="208" /></a></div><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Maria Dahvana Headley's <i>Magonia</i> isn't exactly the book you think it's going to be. When it starts off, its protagonist is on the verge of dying from a mysterious respiratory illness that has plagued her for her entire life. All right, you think. Here goes another acerbic, wonderful dying teen girl, leaving behind her grieving best friend, and his analytical genius mind, and his tendency to recite pi when he's upset.<br /><br />Okay, so that already sounds like some darn good writing in the sick teens genre. The thing is, that is <i>not</i> the whole story. The rest of the story is the explanation for this setup: that Aza Ray, seemingly unsuited to the basic facts of life on Earth, isn't strictly speaking <i>of</i> the Earth. That while she wheezes through hospital visits, ships fill the skies invisible to humankind, and birds who sing heart-songs live in people's chests. That while she waits for the day she will die (too young), shapeshifters and flying cities and missing mothers and brutal politics close in. They are coming to rip Aza Ray out of the only world she remembers, into one where she is told that she belongs.<br /><br /><i>Magonia</i> is a brand-new book, inventive, soaring, and unique, and definitely one to check out.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b>FIVE BOOKS TO READ ALONGSIDE <i>MAGONIA</i></b></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b>1. <i>Stardust </i>by Neil Gaiman</b><br /><br />Boy crosses forbidden wall in normal English village; nine months later, boy is left with a baby. Some years after that, the baby goes back across the wall to catch a fallen star for the girl he <i>thinks</i> is the love of his life. Instead he finds out the the star is a (very interesting) person, gets in a lot of trouble at the hands of greedy witches and power-hungry princes, and discovers that his birthright has been on that side of the wall all along...<br /><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b>2. <i>Seraphina </i>by Rachel Hartman</b><br /><br />Seraphina has been hiding her half-dragon heritage for her entire life. That has meant hiding herself. But her music is beginning to draw her into the limelight, dragon-human politics are becoming increasingly tense, and Seraphina has just learned that she and other half-dragons can find each other telepathically. Soon Seraphina may have to take a stand--where everyone can see it. The long-long-long anticipated sequel to this one just came out, and you'll be glad you don't have to wait.<br /><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b>3. <i>A Great and Terrible Beauty</i> by Libba Bray</b><br /><br />After Gemma Doyle's mother is murdered, Gemma is sent packing from India to attend her mother's old boarding school. The only saving grace of the school, aside from Gemma's few friends, is a magical discovery: a haunting other world where they have the power to make everything they dream of real. But they're not the only people who know about this magical country--and some of what lurks there is deadly and heartless. <br /><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b>4. <i>Elsewhere </i>by Gabrielle Zevin</b><br /><br />The first thing that happens is that Elizabeth Marie Hall dies in a car crash. Then, the story begins: Liz arrives in a strange, quiet place--not quite heaven, not hell, just...elsewhere. As she adjusts to life after death, her family grieves her in their life after <i>her</i> death. Will any of them be able to let go? Surprisingly, <i>Elsewhere</i> isn't a devastating book--it's thoughtful, original, and about learning to look for what comes next. <br /><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b>5. <i>The Golden Compass </i>by Phillip Pullman</b><br /><br />Impetuous Lyra has grown up sheltered by Oxford's many walls, with only herself and Pan, the animal embodiment of her soul, for company. But thanks to the machinations of distant parents and heartless strangers, she is thrust into a world of witches, portals, armored bears, missing children, and cruel plots that could forever twist her world into an ugly, death-filled place.<br /><br />~<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">So those are my recommendations for if you want to get your head <i>into </i>the clouds instead of out of them. None of them are entirely safe, but they're sure to be exhilarating. Happy reading!</div></div>
