Fall is here and sweaters are out in force. The air is crisp and the leaves are starting to turn, setting the mood for my favorite holiday - Halloween!

That means COSTUMES. As happens every year I have about a million ideas of who I want to be and 90% of them are book characters! The challenge however, is to find the delicate balance between a character people will actually recognize, and one that everyone under the sun won't be dressing up as.

A challenge indeed.

[Ada Twist Scientist by Andrea Beaty ill. by David Roberts](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781419721373) - How cute this costume would be! Not to mention super easy: polka dot dress, pig tails, goggles, plastic gloves, polka dot socks and some cute shoes. Oh and don't forget the note pad, pencil and QUESTIONS!

[Peter Brown](http://www.peterbrownstudio.com/), author of many delightful picture books graced us earlier this year with his first middle grade novel [Wild Robot](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316381994). Who wouldn't want to be a robot for Halloween?! In the story Roz, a robot stranded on an island, adopts a little duckling and raises him with the help of her new forest friends. You could go delightfully old school with lots of tin foil and cardboard, then add in a cute stuffed duckling and away you go! What fun!

Now this next one would be a labor of love but boy would it be worth it! [Tony DiTerlizzi](http://diterlizzi.com/home/art-gallery/) is author and illustrator of one of my all time favorite books [The Search for WondLa](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781416983118), the first in a very delightful trilogy. A futuristic sci-fi adventure for middle grades (and everyone else!), this would be a challenging costume sure to turn heads.

![](/uploads/versions/search-for-wondla---x----266-400x---.jpg)SOMEDAY I will have sewing skills good enough to tackle this costume with all my heart. Luckily, the whole trilogy is chock-full of gorgeous illustrations so there is a lot of material to work from!

[I Want My Hat Back by Jon Klassen](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763655983)- who doesn't want to be a grumpy bear for Halloween? Add a red triangle hat and away you go!

I could go on for days with all the ideas running around in my busy head, but I leave it up to you to check out these few more: [The Day the Crayons Quit by Oliver Jeffers](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780399255373), [The Princess and the Pony by Kate Beaton](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780545637084), [Roller Girl by Victoria Jamieson](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780803740167), [Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781302900052), [Ms. Marvel](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780785196112), [Wings of Fire](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780545349253) (if your up for being a DRAGON, I personally would go for being a Rain Wing)

Good luck and happy costuming!
