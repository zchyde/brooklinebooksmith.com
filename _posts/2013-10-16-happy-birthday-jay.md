My baby brother and I have the same birthday, a decade and a half apart. &nbsp;My fifteenth birthday was spent in a hospital waiting room sitting placidly while my mother gave birth. As the only boy in our family, he has been saved from hand-me-down dresses and dolls with tangled hair, but still ends up getting everything after my sister and I are done with it. &nbsp;His bedroom is scattered with a motley collection of electronics, old beanies, and books he poached from my shelves. <br /><br />For his birthday, my perpetual gift is a pile of books. &nbsp;We have similar tastes, meaning I'm very good at selecting books that he'll read ravenously. &nbsp;The only downside is that means&nbsp;<i>I</i>&nbsp;will also read the books ravenously before sending them to him, making his books yet another accidental hand-me-down. &nbsp;On occasion I read his books with post-its, writing "!!!" and popping it on the page after a salient plot point so he'll call me afterwards. &nbsp;We've consumed Kazu Kibuishi's <i>Amulet</i>&nbsp;series, Gene Yang's graphic adaptations of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>, all of the Rick Riordan books, Doug TenNapel's books for younger readers, Raina Telgemeier's graphic adaptations of <i>The Baby-Sitter's Club,</i>&nbsp;and pored over dozens of galleys. <br /><br />This year he is turning thirteen, and I know that my days of brilliant gift-giving may soon come to an end. &nbsp;He has an iPhone. &nbsp;He's starting high school next fall. &nbsp;He knows what twerking is. &nbsp;He isn't a baby anymore, even though I insist on calling him my baby brother.<br /><br />As he matures, I'm curious to see where he'll go with his reading. &nbsp;Will he follow in my ravenous Nicholson Baker footsteps? &nbsp;Will he like Christopher Moore? &nbsp;Will he discover Jessica Hagedorn? &nbsp;Will he still love the books he read as a kid? &nbsp;For now, I'm able to give him the following books that I know he'll love: Gene Yang's <i>Boxers/Saints</i>&nbsp;boxed set, the new Kazu Kibuishi <i>Explorer</i>&nbsp;collection, and a book that some dude scribbled in.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A_UnOI5NyjM/UlhKWsb2ifI/AAAAAAAACes/tfDjzPMQqmA/s1600/photo+(1).JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A_UnOI5NyjM/UlhKWsb2ifI/AAAAAAAACes/tfDjzPMQqmA/s320/photo+(1).JPG" width="239" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">In which we learn having an events director as a sister has its benefits</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Happy birthday, Jay.
