<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">If you have come into the store recently, you might have noticed that things feel slightly different right around the young adult section. That is because, let me gleefully tell you, this year the YA section achieved the holy bookstore grail of MORE SHELF SPACE. We now have an entire extra bookcase for this awesome and beloved (and you know we love it--have you seen all the recs we have up over there?) section. And we are doing everything we can with it.<br /><br /><b>Point One</b>--We have a nonfiction section! From biography to history to self-help, you can check out the top shelf for some truly excellent books. <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781416959045">Model </a>is Cheryl Diamond's memoir of entering the cutthroat world of high fashion in NYC. In <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781442446236">The Pregnancy Project</a>, teenager Gaby Rodriguez feigns pregnancy to find out firsthand the limits of people's acceptance. Award-winning children's author Jack Gantos relates his time in prison in <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780312641573">Hole in My Life</a>. And here you can also find National Book Award winner <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780399252518">Brown Girl Dreaming</a>.<br /><br /><b>Point Two</b>--Below nonfiction you will also find YA poetry and short story anthologies! Pro tip: short stories are a great way to find new authors, get around an antsy brain, or read on public transit. <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763675547">The Great War</a> is a new anthology of World War II stories by incredible authors, each based on a real relic from the war. <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781630790127">Love and Profanity</a> will bring you a more modern realistic angle, and <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316212939">Rags &amp; Bones</a> is a very cool collection of retold classics. For poetry, try <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780670014798">Please Excuse This Poem: 100 New Poets For the Next Generation</a>.<br /><br /><b>Point Three</b>--All of your devoted kids' booksellers got to suggest some older books to bring in, books we desperately want to give you so that you can be as happy about them as we are. There are a bunch (and you should ask us when you see us what they are), but here are a few.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jLmd0rm_d2A/VTltAXCAmXI/AAAAAAAAAHA/AkJcxFTmvnY/s1600/IMG_0571.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jLmd0rm_d2A/VTltAXCAmXI/AAAAAAAAAHA/AkJcxFTmvnY/s1600/IMG_0571.JPG" width="240" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Kylie </b>brought in <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781939765901">The Looking Glass</a> by Jessica Arnold, a quaint story about a girl who goes to a B&amp;B with her family and then gets sucked into a Victorian version of the hotel by an angry ghost who probably wants to kill her. She also picked Kenneth Oppel's exuberant and exhilarating steampunk novel <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780060531829">Airborn</a>, which is one of her favorite books OF ALL TIME.<br /><br /><b>Clarissa</b> picked Lauren DeStefano's <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781442409064">Wither</a>, the first book in the Chemical Garden Trilogy--a dystopian romance of epic bioengineering proportions--and Rick Yancey's <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781416984498">The Monstrumologist</a>, a satisfyingly creepy blend of mystery, horror, and monster thriller.<br /><br /><b>Amy </b>got us four-books-in-one <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781595144119">Balefire</a>, which includes secret twins, secret magic, and New Orleans witchcraft--basically everything good--and Amelia Atwater-Rhodes's <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780385738941">Den of Shadows Quartet</a>, which is absolutely delightful supernatural fantasy about tough girls, beautiful guys, and scary close-knit families with weapons and magic powers. Also, AA-R wrote them as a teenager. We should all be so awesome.<br /><br />I, <b>Alex </b>asked for the <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780064472685">Chronicles of Chrestomanci</a> by Diana Wynne Jones, because they are brain-tickling, lively, funny, wonderful fantasies. And if you like <i>Supernatural </i>or <i>The Raven Boys</i> or witchy, demonic, delightful books with great plots, you need to read Sarah Rees Brennan's <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781416963806">The Demon's Lexicon</a> IMMEDIATELY. <br /><br />There are other things happening in our department happening all the time, and we will tell you about more of them soon. For now, come browse our bigger, better, more ultimate YA section! You will find happiness there. It is full of good things. </div>
