With Thanksgiving around the bend (and in the spirit of democracy) I polled booksellers and book lovers from all over the country and asked,

"What book(s) are you most thankful for?"

One series of books got the highest number of votes:

It comes as no surprise that Harry Potter is the book for which folks are most thankful.  For some, the series started a fire.  For others, the series provided a safe space during tumultuous times.

<br>Harry Potter is a unique experience for all.  For me, it was a journey over time – I grew as Harry grew.  And as I became aware of the darkness in the world around me, things got dark at Hogwarts, too.  All along, however,  I knew that if they could make it so could I.  Rowling's epic series changed the world of literature and we are all grateful.

Many of the books people expressed gratitude for were books from their childhood. These books expressed to us a new way of seeing the world.  Levine's *Ella Enchanted* taught a young woman about saving herself. Eric Carle's *The Very Hungry Caterpillar* inspired one bookseller to become an illustrator.  *The Outsiders* showed me the dark truth about being 'cool'.  *A Wrinkle in Time* proved to one young man that he was never too young or too old to fight.

Plenty of old and new classic fiction made the list. One voter cited McCarthy's insights into violence and renewal as a turning point for him.  Cervantes' tale of adventure, romance, and friendship made the cut too, and it's no surprise - it's widely considered as the most influential piece of literature ever written.

Murakami's *Kafka on the Shore* introduced me to the subtlety and power of magical realism. The other books here try to make sense of tragedy, obsession, perception, empathy, and identity, with beautiful prose juxtaposing ugly circumstances.

There are many, *many* more books we are thankful for but not all are photographed.  Altogether, though, these titles make one heck of a reading list.  Come on in and pick up any one of these incredible titles.  You never know – it could change your life.
