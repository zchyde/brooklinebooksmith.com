In <i>Of Mice and Men</i>, one of the main characters, Lenny, famously has a fondness for "soft things." And whom among us isn't tactile, perhaps not to the intense&nbsp;degree&nbsp;of Lenny himself, but there is something about the feel of tiny, hoppy bunnies--or particularly well-made books--that makes them that much more satisfying to enjoy.<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qw0aHuqGgKo/TtUuWNpdSMI/AAAAAAAAAMg/5f-yCuSwg_s/s1600/deckle.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; display: inline !important; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qw0aHuqGgKo/TtUuWNpdSMI/AAAAAAAAAMg/5f-yCuSwg_s/s200/deckle.jpg" width="200" /></a>Maybe the most obvious texture that a lot of favorite books have is the deckled edge, the byproduct of an old way of papermaking that leaves the edges of a paper artfully rough (observe photo left). Nowadays, only artisans make paper this way, so when you get a book with these edges it's usually faked by a machine to make the book look real legit. But it does have a certain fancy feel to it, even if it makes it difficult to flip through the pages. Sometimes a book is given a fancy texture in another way. Varnishes, like metallic foil or spot gloss are pressed onto a cover to give the color of the jacket more <b>POP</b>&nbsp;and the result is also a tactile delight. The embossing on some covers, too, gives a subtle look to the jacket but also makes it really pleasant to hold, and also therefore more difficult to put down.<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-boOw1AaaY5k/TtUyAdiXh7I/AAAAAAAAAMw/ztS34lJ8iok/s1600/oz.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="139" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-boOw1AaaY5k/TtUyAdiXh7I/AAAAAAAAAMw/ztS34lJ8iok/s320/oz.jpg" width="320" /></a>Recent books that employ this technique really well are the <a href="http://us.penguingroup.com/static/pages/classics/penguinthreads.html" style="text-align: left;">Penguin Threads series</a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="text-align: left;"> designed by magically amazing artist Jillian Tamaki. For three recent reprintings of </span><i>Black Beauty, Emma</i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;and </span><i>The Secret Garden</i>, Tamaki HAND-EMBROIDERED jacket illustrations, and when the books were printed, the texture of the threads was embossed on the cover, making them stunning art objects that are compulsively touchable. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alonewolverine/">Rachel Sumpter</a> is designing the next three covers for <i>Wind in the Willows, Wizard of Oz</i> and <i>Little Women</i>. They are STUNNING.<br /><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br /></div></div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cEv62e_5R4s/TtUyaJB_aXI/AAAAAAAAAM4/RVZFzrIspdc/s1600/firmin.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cEv62e_5R4s/TtUyaJB_aXI/AAAAAAAAAM4/RVZFzrIspdc/s1600/firmin.jpg" /></a>Of course, sometimes texture and touch are employed in the design of a book in a way that is integral to the text. <i>Firmin </i>by Sam Savage (a recent&nbsp;acquisition&nbsp;in the UBC) is the story of a rat born in a 1960s Boston bookstore (not us!) who devours literature both literally and figuratively. The book is die cut with a huge bite-mark taken out of the right side, all the way through the book. It's a playful way of introducing a central element of the story into the design, and makes it a really fun book to pick up and inspect. It's sort of a grown-up version of classic touch-and-feel books like <i>Pat the Bunny</i>, where images, text and texture combine to help young toddlers in the tactile phase with language acquisition. This phenomenon is timeless, and since the publication of <i>Pat the Bunny</i>&nbsp;in 1940 there have been a plethora of additions to this category of books. A more recent one that I'm particularly fond of is Betsy Snyder's <i>Have You Ever Tickled a Tiger</i>&nbsp;which employs some really creative materials to imitate turtle skin and walrus whiskers in particular.<br /><br />This completes my little blog-series on senses by-the-book.
