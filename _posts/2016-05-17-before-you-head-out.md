[The Bicycling Coloring Book – Journey to the Edge of the World by Shan Jiang&nbsp;](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781780677491)

This detailed coloring book will certainly take you places. While most coloring books are geared toward calming meditation, this book asks its audience to journey into a wild, psychedelic new reality.&nbsp;

Whether you're riding your bike this Summer or admiring the composition of spokes and wheels on your tea towel we have everything you'll need for your journey.&nbsp;

As the weather warms up get outside, ride a bike (or wear a bike) and come visit your favorite local bookstore.
