If you're spending time indoors grab a copy of [The Bicycling Coloring Book – Journey to the Edge of the World by Shan Jiang&nbsp;](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781780677491)

This detailed coloring book will certainly take you places. While most coloring books are geared toward calming meditation, this book asks its audience to journey into a wild, psychedelic new reality.&nbsp;
