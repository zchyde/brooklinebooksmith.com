A beautiful book has been making its way through the children's section.

[![](/uploads/versions/9781101994825---x----268-400x---.jpg)](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781101994825)

Lauren Wolk's middle grade debut, *[Wolf Hollow](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781101994825)*, is a foreboding and contemplative piece of historical fiction set in rural Pennsylvania during World War II. (Amy compared the feeling of reading it to the feeling of reading *[To Kill a Mockingbird](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780061120084).*) Everyone is touched by the war, but Annabelle, the book's young narrator, knows the town itself as a safe and peaceful place–until the arrival of one fourteen-year-old girl.

Betty Glengarry is a charmer of grown-ups and a vicious bully towards her fellow children. Her stay with her grandparents is spoken of sideways, and never fully explained. Annabelle, the first target of Betty's violence, is silent initially; but the situation escalates frighteningly and fast. When Betty disappears, Annabelle finds that she is the one person who can protect the wordless, wandering, and rifle-bearing veteran suspected of kidnapping her. She finds, as well, that she may be her cruel tormentor's only hope of getting home.

There are several points at which the book is almost unbearably good at complicated darkness. Annabelle's private feelings and her whole sense of rightness and safety collide over and over with the fresh points of conflict, violence, and distrust that are inflicted on her peaceful life. Betty Glengarry is truly terrifying, a life-sized villain without any remorse, but when her life is at risk, Annabelle's fear *for* her runs alongside.

Annabelle is an honest narrator, so it doesn't feel like a spoiler to say that this book doesn't end in laughter and a parade. Now, you really need to read it for yourself to determine whether you think it's a good ending, or the right ending. But I'd say strongly that you shouldn't turn away from it for having a sad ending.

In [my post last Monday](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/2016/05/02/welcome-to-childrens-book-week/), I quoted former Ambassador for Children's Literature Kate DiCamillo in her 2008 Newbery acceptance speech, where she talks about the fact of darkness in the lives of children, and the value in acknowledging that in their books. I kept thinking of that while I read this book.

It's easy as a bookseller (and I suspect as a parent) to shy away from difficult stories for children, no matter how much we might have liked them ourselves. But I think a flat out ban is an awful mistake, especially when I remember myself as a kid. I didn't just like kid tragedies–I *devoured* them.

Some of my most wretchedly torn-up paperbacks were Katherine Paterson's classically devastating [*Bridge to Terabithia*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780060734015) and Betsy Byars's *[The Pinballs](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780064401982).*I sobbed my way several times through Rachel Anderson's *The Bus People*(an extremely out of print short story collection about the private lives of passengers on a school bus for disabled students. I have no idea how it would read to me now, but at eleven, I was repeatedly, thoroughly devastated.) Raymond Briggs' picture book enemy of happiness, [*The Snowman*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780394884660), goes through a whole awesome night of parties and Santa Claus and learning about kitchen appliances before the sun comes up and he melts, out of existence, FOREVER.

(Admission: this is one of those cases where I do prefer the movie. The movie has that soundtrack, the kind of catch-in-your-throat music that leads five-year-olds who enjoy the *profound sorrow of story* to sit around looking wistful and elfin.)

Sad stories for young readers aren't uncommon; more than that, a lot of them are enduring. Robert Cormier's brutally nihilistic novels (such as *[The Chocolate War](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780375829871)*, *[After the First Death](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780440208358)*, and *[The Rag and Bone Shop](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780440229711)*) shaped young adult fiction alongside [Lurlene McDaniel](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/site/lurlene%20mcdaniel)'s sappy heartbreakers. (If you think John Green's [*The Fault in Our Stars*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780142424179) made the "dying teen girl" a YA superstar, hearken to Lurlene.)

Louise Fitzhugh's *[Harriet the Spy](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780440416791)* turns out all right, but her entire book is about Harriet finding out that she's been kind of a jerk this whole time. Never once do the characters in Karen Hesse's oppressive [*Out of the Dust*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780590371254) actually get out of the dust. Lemony Snicket capitalizes on horrible endings for twelve volumes (!!) in *[A Series of Unfortunate Events](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/site/series%20of%20unfortunate%20events)*. In [*The Watsons Go to Birmingham–1963*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780440228004), Christopher Paul Curtis ends on a historical note of senseless violence, and his young main character's attempt to cope with a world that's dangerous for no reason. E.B. White's *[Charlotte's Web](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780064400558)*is famous for its talking pig, of course, but what everyone remembers intensely is Charlotte at the end.

It's not a new theme, and it's also not a fading one.

Not all good, sad kids' books end tragically. Some end uncompromisingly, but with a sense of triumph, like Dan Gemeinhart's *[The Honest Truth](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780545665742).* Holly Goldberg Sloan's *[Counting by 7s](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780142422861)*is entirely about the agonizing and delicate search for love and safety in the aftermath of tragedy. But my point is: tragedy should be allowed as an endpoint.

Patrick Ness's 2011 young adult novel *[A Monster Calls](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763660659)*is about catharsis and acceptance and grief, and you will grieve cathartically until your stomach hurts. More recently, Kathi Appelt's *[Maybe a Fox](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781442482425),*and Gary Schmidt's [*Orbiting Jupiter*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780544462229) (two of kids' bookseller Clarissa's favorites from the past year) both steadfastly refused to end on a light note. Leila Sales's historical/time travel family story *[Once Was a Time](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781452140094),*which bookseller India recommends, has a sad ending as well.

All stories need good endings. Not all good endings are happy, and not all happy endings are right. You can tell when an ending is right. It feels better to read the right ending where something terrible happens than any happy wrong ending–an easy ending, where the characters get off without a scratch and you turn the last pages feeling cheated and lost.

Of course, not everyone will agree that these endings are good endings. In fact, one of the books I've mentioned–and I leave you to guess which one–has a sad ending that I can't stand. For me, it doesn't work at all. That's the nature of reading. But sad endings do work. Books with sad endings endure, and are taught and cried over and dogeared and kept for decades after someone's ten-year-old heart is broken by the last few pages for the first time.

The important thing not to be afraid of, as an adult sharing books with children, is young readers craving difficult things. Sometimes we all crave difficult things, stories that we, the readers, will survive–even if not all of the characters do. Sometimes what we need at the end of a book is an ache at the back of our hearts, that will still be there years later, when we have grown up.
