Trump a drumpfy day by humping your old books down to the [UBC](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/used-books/). We'll chuck more than chump change your way, and then you can dump the rest in the [nearest donation box](https://www.mtwyouth.org/book_donations/book_containers/). We're advocating serious redistribution of wealth, information and stories. Share those books, there's somebody out there who needs them like you wouldn't believe.

Oh, hey, before I forget, the President asked us to [make this go viral](http://mashable.com/2016/03/14/president-obama-lin-manuel-miranda-rose-garden-freestyle/#ti3i0qbNSaqK). As I understand it, that's one of his duties to get things to go viral. No obstructionists here!

All unannounced, the mercurial Kanye West has been [changing lyrics to some of his already-released songs](http://www.bustle.com/articles/147577-are-the-life-of-pablo-lyrics-changing-kanye-wests-album-is-still-a-work-in-progress). His latest album was released as a streaming-only affair, so there is no "hardcopy" so to speak. This sort of fluid revision might be new to the music industry, but check out that guy in the picture. He's one of several sneaky authors who I have caught in the act over the years, painstakingly hand-editing their published works right here in the store.

The [Man Booker International Prize longlist](http://themanbookerprize.com/news/man-booker-international-prize-2016-longlist-announced) has been announced, take a look now and start reading fast, so that you can be all OH YEAH, NO, I READ THAT, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THAT HOT around the water cooler once the winners are announced.&nbsp; Because that's why we read, am I right?&nbsp; No, [this is why we read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIEeakeXvMM).

Thanks for reading,

Paul
