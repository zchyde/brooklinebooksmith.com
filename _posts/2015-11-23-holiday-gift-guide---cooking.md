**![](/uploads/versions/9781607748229---x----306-400x---.jpg)The NoMad Cookbook** by Daniel Humm and Will Guidara ([**Buy**](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781607748229))

This is one of the most beautiful cookbooks I’ve ever seen. It’s the product of pioneering restaurateurs Daniel Humm and Will Guidara, who distilled the experience of sitting down at their Manhattan dining hall into one elegant volume (technically two, since the last chapter is composed of false pages that form a box for a pocket-size cocktail guide). The recipes range from the minimalist (butter-dipped radishes with fleur de sel) to the decadent (duck roasted with apricots, chamomile and swiss chard), but all are exquisite enough to put stained glass windows to shame. There is one tomato tart with eggplant and rosemary that might be too dazzling to even eat, but if you decide otherwise, you’ll always have the picture.

**![](/uploads/versions/9781400069989---x----283-400x---.jpg)My Kitchen Year: 136 Recipes That Saved My Life** by Ruth Reichl ([**Buy**](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781400069989))

If there’s anyone who can harmonize the turning of seasons, the solitude of nature, the intimacy of a diary and the reverent joy of food, it’s Ruth Reichl. Following the abrupt shuttering of Gourmet magazine after 10 years as its editor, Reichl retreats into the practice of cooking, weighing every step - from visiting the butcher’s shop to sprinkling the final pinch of salt - as equal parts of a ritual that soothes and centers the preparer. This treasure of a cookbook takes us through a year with Reichl, and we get both the long walk through snowy woods and the roast chicken and apple crisp that follow.

**![](/uploads/versions/9781742709161---x----319-400x---.jpg)East: Culinary Adventures in Southeast Asia** by Leanne Kitchen and Antony Suvalko ([**Buy**](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781742709161))

I picked up East thinking it was an opportunity to experience the kitchens and street vendors of Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand and the rest of Southeast Asia at a fraction of what it would cost to make the trip. I wasn’t wrong, but Leanne Kitchen and Antony Suvalko’s loving descriptions and photos of the region have me all fired up to try a bowl of their duck and egg noodle soup while “watching the sun sink into the Mekong,” or nibble tamarind prawns at a lunch spot in Java to the “rhythmic thud of cooks pounding the freshest ingredients into fragrant curry pastes.” As a cook, my favorite part of this book is the opening section, “Basic Recipes,” which covers many stocks, sauces, spice blends and other staples of eastern cuisine that appear in most main dishes and might otherwise intimidate the home cook.

**![](/uploads/versions/9781607746232---x----291-400x---.jpg)NOPI: The Cookbook** by Yotam Ottolenghi and Ramael Scully  ([**Buy**](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/97816077463232))

From Yotam Ottolenghi, the visionary behind best-selling cookbooks Plenty and Jerusalem, comes another collection destined to become a classic. Ottolenghi rose to fame as a food columnist for The Guardian, beloved for his unpretentious but relentlessly innovative use of flavors and techniques. This latest book is named for his acclaimed restaurant, where Londoners gather daily for the parade of seasonal new dishes and beloved favorites. Be warned, this is not a book for the conservative palate - it is a wildly celebratory tribute to global cuisine. At the top of my to-cook list: Jerusalem artichoke soup with hazelnut and spinach pesto; gurnard baked in banana leaf with pineapple chile sambal and sticky sesame rice; pearl barley risotto with watercress, asparagus, and pecorino; and baked blue cheesecake with pickled beets and honey.

**![](/uploads/versions/9781101874868---x----309-400x---.jpg)Vegetarian India: A Journey Through the Best of Indian Home Cooking** by Madhur Jaffrey ([**Buy**](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781101874868))

The first book I read after becoming a vegetarian ten years ago was by Madhur Jaffrey. Thinking back I can’t remember if it was a memoir full of food or a cookbook full of her childhood in India - no one pairs clear, culinary instruction with cultural background the way she does. Her latest, Vegetarian India, is decidedly a cookbook, and it dispels any notions you may have about the limits of meatless dishes - the scope includes the traditions of dozens of cultures within India and ventures into the modern with Western ingredients like corn and quinoa. These recipes are for herbivores and omnivores alike.

**![](/uploads/versions/9781101907597---x----255-400x---.jpg)Stories from the Kitchen** edited by Diana Secker Tesdell ([**Buy**](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781101907597))

Composed of classic literature’s choicest delicacies, this new anthology collects stories, memories, excerpts and ruminations into a snug, bright little hardcover. From sumptuous feasts to humble hearth gatherings, these writings dwell on the universal experience of a shared meal. Within you’ll find foodie mainstays like M.F.K. Fisher and Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin; luminaries like Virginia Woolf and Marcel Proust; and modern storytellers like Amy Tan and Nora Ephron, to name just a few.
