Yesterday's PW Daily (the newsletter of <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/"><em>Publishers Weekly</em> </a>magazine) reported that Marilynne Robinson's new novel has been sold to FSG (since it's a short article I've posted it in its entirety):<br /><br />"Marilynne Robinson, whose bestselling second novel, <strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780312424404">Gilead</a></em></strong>, took the 2005 Pulitzer Prize in addition to the National Book Critics Circle Award, has signed again with Jonathan Galassi at Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux for a new novel. Robinson has just completed the book, to be called <em>Home</em>. Ellen Levine at Trident sold U.S. rights only. <em>Home</em> shares its setting with <em>Gilead</em>, and its action is concurrent with that novel’s. Characters from <em>Gilead</em> will also appear in Home. FSG plans a September 2008 publication. Robinson’s first novel, <strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780312424091">Housekeeping</a></em></strong>, published in 1980, won the PEN/Hemingway award and was nominated for the Pulitzer."<br /><br />I'm really pleased to hear that we'll be getting a new novel from Ms. Robinson so soon (it was twenty three years between her first two!), but I was startled when I read that it will take place in the same world as <em>Gilead</em>. I feel a little disappointed and I can't put my finger on why, exactly. But I'm looking forward to being proven wrong!
