![](/uploads/versions/banned---x----332-500x---.jpg)There are still tickets left for an amazing event on October 11th at 7pm with [Patti Smith](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-10/patti-smith---m-train/) at Berklee College. The [National Book Award](http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2010_nf_smith.html#.V9L9NjWwks4)-winning author will be talking about her latest memoir with Boston native Michael Patrick MacDonald ([*All Souls*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780807072134)). [*M Train*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781101875100) is an unforgettable odyssey of a legendary artist, told through the cafés and haunts she has worked in around the world. She has described the book as "a roadmap to my life." After the conversation, Smith will perform a few songs for the lucky audience. [Get your tickets now!](http://www.etix.com/ticket/p/8734738/brookline-booksmith-presents-patti-smith-for-m-train-in-conversation-with-michael-patrick-macdonald-boston-berklee-performance-center)
<br>
<br>But that's just one highlight of the new season of events suddenly upon us - we're looking forward to bringing [Teju Cole](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-10/teju-cole---known-and-strange-things-essays/), [Box Brown](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-10/box-brown-in-conversation-with-liz-prince---tetris-the-games-people-play/), [Susan Quinn](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-09/susan-quinn---eleanor-and-hick-the-love-affair-that-shaped-a-first-lady/), [Sherry Turkle](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-10/sherry-turkle---reclaiming-conversation-the-power-of-talk-in-a-digital-age/), and [TC Boyle](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-10/t-c--boyle---the-terranauts/) to the store. And in support of his YA debut, [*Children of Eden*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781501146558), YouTube sensation [Joey Graceffa](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/108-joey-graceffa-children-of-eden-book-signing-tickets-27609026341) will return to Booksmith on Saturday, October 8th at 5pm. This is a [signing only event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/108-joey-graceffa-children-of-eden-book-signing-tickets-27609026341); each ticket purchase gets you a signed book and a photograph with the sweetest guy in the world.
<br>
<br>Actually, we all know that there are plenty of young men vying for the title of sweetest.
<br>Listen to what a friend of mine experienced this week:
<br>"… he emailed me a link to a *Harper's* essay by David Foster Wallace. I know he's a kickass soccer player and killer on the slopes and a math whiz and a hard worker and an all-around good kid, but tell you what. Reading a 20-page essay on grammar snoots and thinking, 'Hey, my stepmom would appreciate this,' is actually what makes him the Best. Kid. Ever."
<br>
<br>The end of September offers a chance to explore the cream of the crop of brand new books - with the release of the long list of [National Book Award nominees](http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2016.html#.V-KimfArL4Y) - as well as the cream of the crop of banned books. Banned Books Week, always good for a laugh. Really, someone banned [*The Stupids*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0-n3LWUGhE)? Another oft-banned classic, *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*, (talking animals NO NO NO we can't have that) is getting a very [exciting special treatment](http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2016/09/salvador-dali-alice-in-wonderland-illustrations/) for its 150th anniversary.
<br>
<br>If I can toot my own horn for a minute - or perhaps tickle my own ivories would be more apt - I invite you to take the Red Line to Ashmont station in Dorchester, so you can play the [piano I painted](http://streetpianos.com/boston2016/pianos/the-carruth/) for the public art project [Street Pianos Boston](http://streetpianos.com/boston2016/). There are 60 of them around town, so keep your eyes and ears open!
<br>
<br>Thanks for reading,
