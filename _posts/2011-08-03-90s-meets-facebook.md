CD-Roms. Static dial-up of the Internet.&nbsp; America Online disks.&nbsp; Life before FaceBook?<br /><br />Jay Asher and Carolyn Mackler's <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781595144911">The Future of Us</a></em> is a serious comedy and a definite novel of awesomeness.&nbsp; While teenagers in the 90s, Josh and Emma discover that they can view Facebook.&nbsp; After they figure out that they are the people on it -- and why someone would put so much random information about themselves on the Internet is beyond them -- they discover it's their lives fifteen years in the future.&nbsp; They also discover that they can change their futures by deliberate and&nbsp;stupid acts.&nbsp; <br /><br />It all comes down to the fact that if we knew what our futures held and could change them, it's not just the future that would change.&nbsp;Really, if you could visibly manipulate the future, would you be afraid of reality or live in the moment?<br /><br />I thought it was a book that I would read and then pass on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope. It's a keeper.&nbsp; I love it!&nbsp; This will be one of the best young adult novels to hit our shelves this year (and Jamie, our YA expert,&nbsp;agrees!).<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: blue;">To be released November 21st.</span></strong>
