![](/uploads/versions/041316n---x----463-437x---.jpg)I suspect some of you have been fully immersed and never want to leave&nbsp;[Ferrante's quartet](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/04/10/success-neapolitan-novels-stranger-than-fiction/3GHNc3Doc0jT2XhACcjpWO/story.html). Or perhaps you are fully focused on your goal of reaching the ten thousandth page of&nbsp;[Knausgaard](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/magazine/karl-ove-knausgaard-on-the-terrible-beauty-of-brain-surgery.html). Maybe you've been laboriously studying legal briefs that might have helped you in your&nbsp;[failed lawsuit](http://www.si.com/nfl/2016/04/06/patriots-fans-deflategate-lawsuit-nfl-roger-goodell-robert-kraft), and all the while you've been suffering from very painful and not-at-all-made-up post-traumatic stress, brought on by the totally biased and unfair investigation into the New England Patriots, and their subsequent loss of a draft pick, which is so biased and unfair that you can't even believe it, or even sleep at night. You've been getting headaches, and no it's not from the beer hat you've had to wear in order to get to sleep at all at night. I wish I could heal your pain.

[Wait, does this help?](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=video&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ-5qP9IvMAhXCPj4KHTWrAJgQtwIIJTAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D8ESgWlzQQag&amp;usg=AFQjCNGeqc8bcnAKxdZ58-QO9Ki5PNMvLQ&amp;sig2=16WD_DnzfSMk1YQlik2bYQ&amp;bvm=bv.119408272,d.cWw)

Maybe you're really smart, and you've been plugging your ears, eyes and nose during our long national nightmare of a presidential primary season. For whatever reason, I am willing to bet that there are some people out there who haven't heard of Hamilton, or it's stone-cold genius creator (and&nbsp;[voracious reader](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/books/review/lin-manuel-miranda-by-the-book.html?_r=0)) Lin-Manuel Miranda. If this is true, then you special few are in for a treat. Get thee to an internet search engine and clear your calendar. As for how this pertains to Booksmith, well, I was hoping to say that you should come in and check out the [amazing new book](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781455539741)&nbsp;about the soon-to-be-global phenomenon…but we sold all of our copies in a single day. I got to take a peek, and let me say that you have to place an order for it when its back in stock in June. It's illustrated with reproductions of original documents, never-before-seen onstage and backstage photographs, and numerous in-depth essays that look at the history, the cast, and every conceivable facet of the production, as well as the joyful philosophy of curiosity and inclusiveness that gives the show its once-in-a-generation inspirational power.

<br>See that other book up there? That one you&nbsp;*can*&nbsp;take a look at, and it is&nbsp;*ravishing*.&nbsp;[Reigning Men](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9783791355207), the accompaniment to the current&nbsp;[LACMA exhibition](http://www.lacma.org/ReigningMen#about-the-exhibition), showcases the highlights of menswear from 1715 to the present. I can't stop looking through this book, it's stunning.

Stuck in some horrid backwater, far from Coolidge Corner? Thanks to a charming YouTuber, you can get a little taste of home via this&nbsp;[video tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKWTvi93fM&amp;index=18&amp;list=WL)&nbsp;of Booksmith (and especially our YA section.)

<br>Over on our&nbsp;[blog](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/2016/04/12/this-week-in-books-israeli-sponsorship-draws-author-outcry/)&nbsp;my compatriots are hanging out at the intersection of freedom of expression and Israeli/Palestinian politics, and touching on some other only slightly less incendiary topics.
<br>
<br>Okay, that's all for this week, but do yourself a favor and&nbsp;[check this out](https://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks/162052542).
<br>
<br>Oh, wait! My son had his theatrical debut last night, as a member of the ensemble in Cabot After School Program's production of Beauty & the Beast. He had a line - "Who?" - and brandished a rake menacingly as part of the mob. He wore a truly enormous hat, and was paid for his performance in ice cream and hot butterscotch.

Thanks for reading,
<br>Paul

<br>"*I know how upset some of y'all are gettin',
<br>but listen,*In the Heights*ain't closing, this is spreading.
<br>And yeah, I'm up here on this lectern,

<br>somewhere chilling in some outer theater lobby,
<br>and some little high schooler's gonna be playin' Usnavi.
<br>So I want all of y'all to grab this,
<br>cuz that little white kid is gonna know
<br>what a Puerto Rican flag is.*"
