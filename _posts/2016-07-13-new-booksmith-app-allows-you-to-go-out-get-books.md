I've got so many Adichies, Atwoods and Murakamis, but check it out, there's a Beckett!&nbsp;*So*&nbsp;hard to capture Becketts. Don't know what I'm talking about? That's okay, it's&nbsp;[probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKRff0Yp0tQ)&nbsp;for the best.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>I know you probably expect me to be an unrelentingly voracious reader, but I must admit that I've let that habit slide this summer. My house is empty; the family has gone to California for a few weeks without me, and that means I get a lot of uninterrupted time in the studio. So it's down with books, up with brushes. And the other thing is, it's July. My lifelong love of the greatest of all sporting events means it's a couch life for three weeks. The Tour de France schedule can be brutal on the spectator, and I can only do so much with the little time it leaves me. But believe it, when I crack open that first book in August it is gonna be amazing, a real head rush.&nbsp;
<br>In the meantime, may&nbsp;[Thibaut Pinot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqBSYAihPOs)&nbsp;wear that polka dot jersey all the way to Paris! And may this inspired team keep racking up victories, so they can give more&nbsp;[bikes to kids](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/07/12/sport/cylcing-africa-dimension-data-qhubeka/index.html)&nbsp;back home.
<br>
<br>This was my son and his mother while they were packing toiletries for their vacation:&nbsp;
<br>"What's frizz cream?"
<br>"It keeps my hair from being frizzy."&nbsp;
<br>"What's curl cream?"
<br>"It keeps my hair curly."&nbsp;
<br>"WHY ARE YOU SO FASHIONABLE?!"&nbsp;
<br>
<br>One programming note before we move on: Our good friends&nbsp;[The Follen Angels](http://www.follenangels.com/)&nbsp;are back in town, and ready to give you a ring-a-ding evening to remember! Enjoy a Sensational Sinatra concert and buffet dinner at the Holiday Inn, Brookline on Friday July 22nd at 7pm. Come in to Booksmith and get your tickets before they sell out!
