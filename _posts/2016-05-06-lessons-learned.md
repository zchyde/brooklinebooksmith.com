I cannot think of a time in my life where I did not love to read. My father was a submariner so he was often out at sea, and my mother was a social worker who toiled on for long hours into the night. Despite their busy schedules, my fondest childhood memories with my parents revolved around books. My mother would take me to the library and record herself reading aloud my favorite stories so that I could listen to them as often as I'd like whether or not she was around. Her particular version of the song the mother sings in [Love You Forever](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780920668375)by Robert Munsch will be forever ingrained in my heart. My father would share with me lists of his favorite books from childhood, and when he returned from the watery depths, I would gush to him about my thoughts on Charlie and his bizarre adventures at that chocolate factory or Milo's quest to rescue the Princesses of Sweet Rhyme and Pure Reason.

> "Suppose we have only dreamed, or made up, all those things-trees and grass and sun and moon and stars and Aslan himself. Suppose we have. Then all I can say is that, in that case, the made-up things seem a good deal more important than the real ones. Suppose this black pit of a kingdom of yours is the only world. Well, it strikes me as a pretty poor one. And that's a funny thing, when you come to think of it. We're just babies making up a game, if you're right. But four babies playing a game can make a play-world which licks your real world hollow. That's why I'm going to stand by the play world. I'm on Aslan's side even if there isn't any Aslan to lead it. I'm going to live as like a Narnian as I can even if there isn't any Narnia."

> -C.S. Lewis, **The Silver Chair**

Like [Paul](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/2016/05/04/this-ones-going-out-to-your-moms/), I read (and re-read) *The Chronicles of Narnia* continually throughout my childhood. Puddlegum's valiant speech to the Green Lady is a constant reminder to me of the strength of hope. How I would much rather be the type of person who believes in all that is beautiful and to let that be the guiding light of my life rather than focusing on the darkness that might surround me. Whenever I find life overwhelming, the mere thought of those words can bring me a bit of sunshine!

> “Go back?" he thought. "No good at all! Go sideways? Impossible! Go forward? Only thing to do! On we go!" So up he got, and trotted along with his little sword held in front of him and one hand feeling the wall, and his heart all of a patter and a pitter.”

> -J.R.R. Tolkien, [**The Hobbit**](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780618260300)

If you ask me where my adventurous spirit comes from I'd say it came from here! I read *The Hobbit* when I was in the 3rd grade because my older brother was reading it in high school at the same time and he hated it! Either to prove him wrong or to get ahead of the game, I picked it up and quickly fell in love. Bilbo's adventures made me long for mountains, and taught me so much about being courageous!

> “To live will be an awfully big adventure.”
>
> -J.M. Barrie, [**Peter Pan**](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062362223)

Oh my sweet never-aging Lost Boy. Peter's story has held a firm place in my heart for ages, but it was only after I read the book in its entirety that I truly understood its importance. Like Wendy, I got lost in my childhood and it took me quite a while to actually be okay with the idea of growing up, but this book taught me that growing older did not also mean losing myself; to live at all is an adventure.

> “Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot,
> <br>Nothing is going to get better. It's not.”

> -Dr. Seuss, [**The Lorax**](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780394823379)

My absolute favorite of Seuss' books. [*The Lorax*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780394823379) not only taught me the importance of caring for the world around me, but with this one simple phrase he also taught me that my actions mattered. A lot.

> “It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”
>
> -J.K. Rowling, [**Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secret**s](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780439064873)

Could I write about influential life lessons from childhood books and NOT mention Queen Jo? (Clearly the answer is no!) I could write for ages about the various things these books have taught me, but if I had to choose only one it would be that it matters not who I hope to be if my actions do not also line up with that hope. The Harry Potter series is rife with themes of the power of our choices! After all, if Harry hadn't chosen to be a Gryffindor things might have gone quite differently for us all!

So here's to the power of reading young, and the gift that each of the books that we read brings!

Cheers!
