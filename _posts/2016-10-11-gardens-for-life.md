Gardens offer lessons on life; the whole-system approach of permaculture does the same.  Permaculture, co-founded in 1968 by [Bill Mollison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mollison) and [David Holmgren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Holmgren), is a design system for ecological and sustainable living - integrating plants, animals, buildings, people, and communities.  Permaculture has 3 core values: care for the planet, care for people, and return the surplus.  These ideas are certainly ones for our everyday lives.  Here are some books that will have you developing, arranging, and planting your sustainable gardens soon.

[<u>Practical Permaculture</u>](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781604694437) by Jessi Bloom and Dave Boehnlein is an easy-to-use eco-guide.  This book helps to break down the many aspects of permaculture into a "can do" opportunity instead of an overwhelming “job.”

Many garden-enthusiasts gather inspiration from planting their flowers, trees, and veggies.  If you're feeling a bit "under-whelmed" with your eco-inspiration, look to these two beautiful poetry collections from the Everyman's Library Pocket Poets Series: [Echoing Green: Poems of Fields, Meadows, and Grasses](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781101907733)  and [Garden Poems](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780679447269).

I’ll leave you with some words of wisdom: “Humankind has not woven the web of life.  We are but one thread within it.  Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves.  All things are bound together.  All things connect.” –Chief Seattle
