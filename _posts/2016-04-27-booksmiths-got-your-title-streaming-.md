![](/uploads/versions/basket3-compressor---x----1000-1350x---.jpg)Visitors to Booksmith often come to us with roses, or poems of &nbsp;love and fidelity written at the first blush of morning. The amount of times we've had to gently refuse someone's hand in marriage - it never becomes easier. Our most ardent browsers stay until 11pm on a Saturday night, perched on a limb of the tree in the kids section, or standing stock still in the Giftsmith, draped in scarves and hats, trying to blend in with the merchandise, hoping beyond hope that we will lock them inside for the night.&nbsp;
<br>We know you love us, but these are not the ways to prove it.&nbsp;
<br>Show your love for Booksmith, or whatever your nearest and dearest independent bookstore may be, by shopping with us this Saturday, April 30th, on national&nbsp;[Independent Bookstore Day](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-04/national-independent-bookstore-day/). We're raffling off those three exciting baskets of Booksmith goodness!&nbsp;[Click here](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/2016/04/25/this-week-in-books-independent-bookstore-day/)&nbsp;to find out how to put your name in the hat.

<br>Now, with the passing of one musical hero and the further ascension of another, this has been a rollercoaster of a week.&nbsp;[Purple Lemonade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_R-nFDyl1g)&nbsp;to cool you down? And if you've already tasted that lemonade, and drunk it to excess the last few days, you've heard the words of&nbsp;[Warsan Shire](https://vimeo.com/38766162), whose poetry is threaded through Beyonc&eacute;'s songs. As a number of people have been calling for it, we went hunting for her work in print, but so far no luck. That probably won't be true for long, though, as the small press that's brought out two volumes of her poetry are probably cranking up the printer this moment.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Booksmith's own Small Press Book Club is getting to work on a different hidden gem, Danielle Dutton's engrossing historical fiction&nbsp;[Margaret the First](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/this-week-in-books/2016/04/04/this-week-in-books-indie-spotlight-on-danielle-dutton/), about the 17th century Duchess who invented science fiction. There is much more to her than that, but for creating&nbsp;[The Blazing World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blazing_World) Margaret Cavendish deserves a million thank yous. They meet to talk about it on May 16th at 7pm.
<br>
<br>Booksmith's other book club, called the Booksmith Book Club, are, as usual, trendsetters of the highest order, having selected Viet Thanh Nguyen's&nbsp;[The Sympathizer](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780802124944)&nbsp;for their next meeting on May 9th, 7:30pm. The&nbsp;[Pulitzer Prize](https://vietnguyen.info/2016/on-winning-the-pulitzer-prize)&nbsp;committee caught wind of their choice and promptly followed suit.&nbsp;
