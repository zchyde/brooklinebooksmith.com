The acad&eacute;mie Goncourt surprised the public this week by awarding the prestigious Prix Goncourt du Premier Roman (Goncourt prize for best and most imaginative debut novel of the year) to a book that was not on the public shortlist, "De nos fr&egrave;res bless&eacute;s" ("From Our Wounded Brothers") by Joseph Andras. Andras made bigger headlines, however, by refusing to accept the prize or its €3,800 award. From [bibliOBS](https://bibliobs.nouvelobs.com/actualites/20160513.OBS0432/joseph-andras-refuse-le-prix-goncourt-du-premier-roman.html) (auto-translated from the French):

> The information was communicated to&nbsp;[20minutes.fr](https://www.20minutes.fr/culture/1842167-20160509-surprise-goncourt-premier-roman-liste)&nbsp;by his press attache at [his publisher] Actes Sud: "I confirm that the author does not accept the prize. He of course thanked the members of the jury who have liked his book, but cannot accept the award because his conception of literature is not compatible with the idea of a competition."

The same source goes on to say that:

> Faced with numerous rumors beginning to run on the identity of the writer, Actes Sud assures 20minutes.fr that they "are in no case hiding someone already known. He simply does not at all wish to be exposed in the media."

[Actes Sud](https://www.actes-sud.fr/contributeurs/andras-joseph) provides Andras's only available press photo, above, and biography:

> Born in 1984, Joseph Andras lives in Normandy. He regularly stays abroad.

A summary of Andras's novel, "De nos fr&egrave;res bless&eacute;s":

> Algiers, 1956. Young Communist anticolonial workers rallied to the FLN (National Liberation Front), Fernand Yveton filed in its plant a bomb that never exploded. For this victimless symbolic act, he is executed on 11 February 1957 and will remain in history as the only European guillotined during the war in Algeria. This novel of burning admiration, stretched by the need for justice and stinging like a death sentence, paid tribute to him.

"De nos fr&egrave;res bless&eacute;s" is not yet available in English.
