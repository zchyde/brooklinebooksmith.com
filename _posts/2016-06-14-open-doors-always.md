Even though the many offerings of "thoughts and prayers" from legislators ring increasingly hollow with each new tragedy, we add ours to the chorus. But we all have more to give than thoughts and prayers: towards whatever action your conscience and reason propels you, it is high time to join your neighbors in peaceful vigil, to sign those petitions, to march shoulder to shoulder. It is always the right time to teach our children, our sons, to open up with love, never with violence. Here are a few things I've come across which bear re-sharing, even if you've already seen them. Here's&nbsp;[Lin-Manuel Miranda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAG_7qeiOZA)'s supremely moving moment at the Tony Awards, a fearfully powerful [response from our community](https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/style/2016/06/15/our-own-private-orlando/QilPzYWFh1xHq91OnoFn1L/story.html), and a message of hope from the[&nbsp;Dalai Lama](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-dalai-lama-why-im-hopeful-about-the-worlds-future/2016/06/13/e380973a-30a2-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html).&nbsp;

<br>The curators of our&nbsp;[Signed First Edition Book Club](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/sfe/)&nbsp;have made&nbsp;[Miss Jane](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780393241730), by Brad Watson, their selection for August. Join today and you'll receive that upcoming title, as well as Yaa Gyasi's monumental debut,&nbsp;[Homegoing](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781101947135). Listen to what one new member of SFE has to say about the new program.
<br>
<br>"As someone who often participates in conversations about literature it is very easy to look backward and lose sight of the texts emerging right before me. The Signed First Editions Book Club not only provides a reminder of the present literary players, but also encourages a participation in the production of literature by offering the rare gift of a first edition. With this book club I get to be a community member, a collector, and a consumer of new words that are just being put forth in the world, which is an exceptional privilege."
