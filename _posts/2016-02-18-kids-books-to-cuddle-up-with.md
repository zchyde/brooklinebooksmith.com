Whether it's been pouring rain, pelting ice, blinding snow, or burning cold, this February has been a month to stay indoors. You could use the time you're trapped inside to feverishly organize everything you own, or you could stare into the forgiving face of Netflix for ten hours at a time. There are ten seasons of *Friends*. There are seven seasons of *Gilmore Girls*. There are a *number* of infinitely re-watchable David Attenborough nature specials. I know. These things are tempting. The David Attenborough specials are very, very good. But what better time to hunker down with a book than when the outdoors are uninviting?

I tend to think that while messy weather is a good time for books, some books are especially good in messy weather. Cuddle weather needs cuddle reads: the books that make your heart content. Here are ten books that I think will make you feel snug, with or without a cup of cocoa.

[*Creaturepedia*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781847806963) by Adrienne Barman - This bright, friendly, fully-illustrated guide to wildlife categorizes creatures like nobody else. Learn to look at animals in all kinds of ways you haven't before, and spend hours happily doing so.

*[Frog and Toad All Year](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780064440592)* by Arnold Lobel - We've had every weather this month, and every weather is in this book. The wonderful thing about Frog and Toad stories is that they always feel whole. They're self-contained and interesting, tremendously funny and generous. A frog and a toad have never taught us more about what it really means to be a friend. (Easy reader.)

[*Coleccion de oro Jorge el curioso*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780547523101) by Margret and H.A. Rey - Our collection of children's books in Spanish has been steadily growing, I'm happy to say, and one of the coziest books among them is this hefty bilingual collection of Curious George stories. They're not the originals, but they've got all of George's style. (Picture book.)

[*Arctic White*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781627791045) by Danna Smith, illustrated by Lee White - In the white winter Arctic, a girl and her family make a breath-catching trek over the nighttime ice to find color in the vast, vivid, brilliant display of the Northern Lights. (Picture book.)

[*The Barefoot Book of Classic Poems*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781905236565) compiled and illustrated by Jackie Morris - Saturated with Jackie Morris's warm, stylish painted illustrations, this is a lovely poetry collection to read together, with plenty of variety in style and tone. (All ages.)

[*The Authoritative Calvin and Hobbes*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780836218220) by Bill Watterson - If you have ever met a kid with their own Calvin and Hobbes books, odds are those things are worn to bits. Calvin and Hobbes aren't just best friends: when you read about them, they're *your* friends. All it takes is them whiling away the hours to while away your own.

[*Tuck Everlasting*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780312369811) by Natalie Babbitt - Winnie Foster finds herself with a momentous choice when she meets the immortal Tuck family. Will she drink the water of life and stay with them always, or go back to normal life? This contemplative classic is a the kind of dream you bask in while you're reading it. Would you make the same choice as Winnie? (Intermediate.)

[*The Radiant Road*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780525953470) by Katherine Catmull - One of my favorite new books of the year so far is this fairy tale of a YA novel. Clare returns to Ireland and faces terrible danger, but Catmull spins her words into warm, living, growing, powerful things. (Young adult.)

When you finally need to just DO SOMETHING, try coloring a page of Kerby Rosanes's [*Animorphia*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780147518361), a coloring book that lets you feel fidgety with a combination of colossal, realistic animals; otherworldly cartoon characters; and doodle pages for your own inventions.

When even that won't do the trick, pull out the secret weapon*: Wee Sing* sing-alongs. These things have been around for decades, with their catchy tunes and kid chorus. [*The Best of Wee Sing*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780843121841) is a compilation of some of their best-loved songs and children's classics. Maybe don't break it out first thing in the morning, but when you all need to blow off a little steam, bellowing along to something cheery can really do the trick.
