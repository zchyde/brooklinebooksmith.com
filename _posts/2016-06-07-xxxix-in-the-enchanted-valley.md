Agustín de Rojas (1949-2011) wrote with a cloaked fang which, when driven into the less burnt-out mushy parts of our brains, would get snagged in a web of synapses causing our emotions to fluctuate - a guffaw followed by a shriek followed by a tranquil *"Whoa…"*.

Last year [Restless Books](https://www.restlessbooks.com) published [*A Legend of the Future*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781632060358) - the first of de Rojas' books to be translated into English - which subsequently dropped a sub-atomic bomb onto my preconceived belief as to what constituted great science fiction. I'll always love the schlocky, non-commital nature of the sci-fi books I devoured as a youth (and as an adult) but there was something - I don't know - *literary* about de Rojas' writing.

And then came an advanced reading copy of his next book - landing on my desk with a sternum-punch of a thud. It is called [*The Year 200*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781632060518) and it is 544 pages long (mostly dialogue!) and it is weird, brazen, and savage. It's [A. Bertram Chandler](https://www.bertramchandler.com/publication.aspx), Douglas Adams, and your aunt or uncle who dabbled in LSD a bit too much in the 60's all rolled into one. How do I even begin to describe the plot?

I'll let the publisher's description lay the foundation:
{: .present-before-paste}

> Centuries have passed since the Communist Federation defeated the capitalist Empire, but humanity is still divided. A vast artificial-intelligence network, a psychiatric bureaucracy, and a tiny egalitarian council oversee civil affairs and quash 'abnormal' attitudes such as romantic love. Disillusioned civilians renounce the new society, foregoing technology to live as 'primitives' or enhance their brains with cybernetic implants to become 'cybos.' When the Empire returns and takes over the minds of unsuspecting citizens […] the world's fate falls into the hands of two brave women.

I'm currently entrenched in chapter 39 and yet for such a massive book I never stop to notice how far I've come or how much I have left. The writing is succinct; it writhes and slithers seamlessly from one reality to the next. It is easily one of the best books I've read in awhile.

[*The Year 200*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781632060518) drops in mid July. You can pre-order a copy through our online shop or swing by in person in a few weeks. We'll have plenty of copies.
