<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Hullo! <br /><br />The last weekend in May I had the privilege of attending BEA (for those of you who don't <strike>stalk</strike> follow the publishing world, BEA stands for Book Expo America and is the big book conference in the US). It was an amazing experience. It was also a very crowded one.<br /><br />I went into the experience with the plan to make the most of it. I printed schedules and maps for each day. I color-coded them. Then before I could even use them they were destroyed in a freak water-based incident.<br /><br />I don't like to talk about it.<br /><br />Anyway, I was up late the night before because I procrastinate and for me packing is an event - a terrible game of possibilities.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8QmDbYdI30Y/VYeyQQ360mI/AAAAAAAAAyk/mab5KebtfIc/s1600/BEAPacking.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="125" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8QmDbYdI30Y/VYeyQQ360mI/AAAAAAAAAyk/mab5KebtfIc/s400/BEAPacking.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">That's what happens AFTER I make a list.</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">That's how I ended up in a train station at 5AM with forty five minutes of sleep and a large, very orange suitcase.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RJlDT_6MLKM/VYeyy9cN8KI/AAAAAAAAAys/R27y5Rf60s4/s1600/BEASuitcase.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RJlDT_6MLKM/VYeyy9cN8KI/AAAAAAAAAys/R27y5Rf60s4/s320/BEASuitcase.jpg" width="248" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">But we got there with lots of coffee and I got to see some amazing things.</div><br />I went to some cool panels that usually went like this:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7kmSR-r-g8Y/VYezJrreHTI/AAAAAAAAAy4/CbaQWXUQ1SY/s1600/BEAPranksters.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="255" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7kmSR-r-g8Y/VYezJrreHTI/AAAAAAAAAy4/CbaQWXUQ1SY/s320/BEAPranksters.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I even got to give Jory John my business card. Jory John has a business card with Stick Figure Amy on it. The very idea is madness.</div><br />As member of the ABA (American Booksellers Association) I was allowed to attend some really amazing events. I saw Mo√Øra Fowley-Doyle (whose debut <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780525429487">The Accident Season</a> is out later this year and is amazing), Nicola Yoon (same with the later this year and brilliance for her debut <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780553496642">Everything Everything</a>). And at one of these events I even had the privilege of meeting Jacqueline Woodson. Then poor Jon Klassen. I say "poor Jon Klassen" because I pretty much swooned at him.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jJNq77pdN2g/VYezJuEQkCI/AAAAAAAAAzY/bU4HRFAxzpc/s1600/BEAKlassen.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jJNq77pdN2g/VYezJuEQkCI/AAAAAAAAAzY/bU4HRFAxzpc/s320/BEAKlassen.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Then on Friday I went to the Children's Breakfast and saw Oliver Jeffers, Rainbow Rowell, Nathan Lane, and James Patterson speak. Oliver Jeffers drew pictures as he spoke and if I wasn't already madly in love I was definitely a goner by that point.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">There was an author speed dating and I saw (if I recall) 16 authors in rapid succession for six minutes at a time. Adam Rubin and Daniel Salmieri were wonderful. Adam Silvera is utterly charming. Gitty Daneshvari is hysterical. My brain pretty much exploded.</div><br />At tea I got to sit with Leigh Bardugo who recognized me from the internet.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SigrxqRLWLQ/VYezJrm_FJI/AAAAAAAAAzM/-opKrRlrNrc/s1600/BEABardugo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="188" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SigrxqRLWLQ/VYezJrm_FJI/AAAAAAAAAzM/-opKrRlrNrc/s320/BEABardugo.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">And she's just an amazing person.</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Also, <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781627792127">Six of Crows</a> is beyond brilliant. Read it when it comes out.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Then there was Scott Westerfeld.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HbHQPlLCvW0/VYezKjchATI/AAAAAAAAAzU/IPhrecOrPZM/s1600/BEAWesterfeld.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HbHQPlLCvW0/VYezKjchATI/AAAAAAAAAzU/IPhrecOrPZM/s320/BEAWesterfeld.jpg" width="259" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">And one of my packing fear came true when I spilled tea on my dress.&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">And one of the weirdest things of the conference was just seeing these amazing authors walking around and trying not to freak out. </div><br />I leaned down to fix my shoe and:<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ON-doqGZZLE/VYezKOtCjPI/AAAAAAAAAzE/8OAxzwblrVQ/s1600/BEAStohl.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="155" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ON-doqGZZLE/VYezKOtCjPI/AAAAAAAAAzE/8OAxzwblrVQ/s400/BEAStohl.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I was so surprised I started choking and had to flee the scene.</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">It felt impossible. Like some alternate world. I couldn't possibly be in the same building as these people.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I ended up in a room with Libba Bray after getting elbowed in the head trying to get in line for her signing (I abandoned the line at that point) and I totally panicked. I knew she'd just been signing for almost two hours and so when I saw her I couldn't think of anything better than to thrust the book at her and say:&nbsp;"I have an awkward and unfortunate question, will you sign this?"</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Which is how this happened:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tQ2VFVxApXk/VYe4hJddJjI/AAAAAAAAAzs/bG5AQdvVnMA/s1600/WP_20150622_03_24_30_Pro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tQ2VFVxApXk/VYe4hJddJjI/AAAAAAAAAzs/bG5AQdvVnMA/s320/WP_20150622_03_24_30_Pro.jpg" width="179" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><br />The whole experience was amazing.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I feel like, for the sake of my job and the possibility of going again I need to point out that I did see a couple of our sales reps and took notes on panels and signings that were well attended and the big buzz books this year.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I did so many more things than I had the chance to stick figure (and some stick figures I started but couldn't finish or had to cut short). I couldn't manage to cohesively put together a short strip about seeing the Merry Sisters of Fate (Maggie Stiefvater, Tessa Gratton, and Brenna Yovanoff) all together. Or hearing Leigh Bardugo defend a woman's right to wear whatever she wanted to someone who wanted to shame cosplayers. Or even getting a free evening to sit in Bryant park and unwind a little and get some writing of my own done.</div><br />Or just the sheer amount of coffee involved in the whole experience.<br /><br />And I went to <a href="http://www.thebookcon.com/">BookCon</a> that weekend too and got to watch Marissa Meyer and Leigh Bardugo play Truth or Dare and Margaret Stohl on a Women in Marvel panel for <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781484726433">Black Widow: Forever Red </a>(which is also really good).<br /><br />The whole five days were amazing. Exhausting and sometimes overwhelming but just amazing.<br /><br />-Amy<br /><br /></div>
