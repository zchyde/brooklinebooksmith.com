Roughly 18 months ago [LitHub](https://lithub.com/) (top-notch news source, [Booksmith book-talk collaborator](https://lithub.com/?s=brookline+booksmith) and publisher of Rebecca Solnit in [all her acerbic brilliance](https://lithub.com/80-books-no-woman-should-read/)) put out one of my favorite literary articles, "[10 Great Writers Nobody Reads](https://lithub.com/ten-great-writers-nobody-reads/)." It's the internet version of why I spend my free time crawling through stack after teetering stack of books in the dusty corners of dilapidated used book stores - it's not because old books smell great ([they do](https://emilygould.tumblr.com/post/86237068875/three-fragrances-for-people-who-love-old-book)), it's so I can unearth something mind-blowing that would otherwise find itself consigned to the abyss.

So last week when LitHub released a follow-up piece, "[10 More Writers Nobody Reads](https://lithub.com/10-more-writers-nobody-reads/)", I was giddy. I highly recommend this list, and its accompanying descriptions. Alas, many of these authors are languishing out of print (for now!), but there are several that we'll be bringing to Brookline post-haste (and the first two titles make a great pair, no?). By this time next week you should see:

Plus, there's always the [Used Book Cellar](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/used-books/) to tickle your more esoteric fancies. I've seen several of these names pass through our inventory (that's where I first encountered Kavan's *Ice*, actually.) If that doesn't keep you busy, quite a few independent presses are dedicated to bringing old masterpieces out of the ether - [Dalkey Archive](https://www.dalkeyarchive.com/) is a favorite, but [hit us up](https://twitter.com/smallpressbkcb) for more suggestions! Meanwhile if you need me, I'll be nose-deep in *Berg*.
