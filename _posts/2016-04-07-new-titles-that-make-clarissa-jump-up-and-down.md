There is an amazing moment as a bookseller when those new titles that you have been waiting and waiting and waiting for FINALLY come out of the box and hit the shelf. The next challenge is to put those new books into as many customers hands as possible! A challenge a bookseller will rise to with gusto.

So.&nbsp;

Without further ado, here are some of the latest titles that make my heart go thump thump thump.

[The Bear and the Piano by David Litchfield](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780544674547)&nbsp;(Picture Book)

---

If this cover doesn't grab you instantly then the story will. Bear, as a cub, finds an old piano deep in the woods. He falls in love from the first "plonk" of the keys. As he grows so does his talent, and soon he is in the big city playing for huge audiences and making all the headlines. But Bear misses home, family, and friends, so he returns to the forest. He was afraid he had been forgotten, but instead Bear finds everyone waiting to hear of his adventures and welcome him back with open arms.&nbsp;

Bear reminds us to follow our dreams and that true family and friends will always be there waiting, even if our dreams take us far away from home. A truly beautiful message in this truly beautiful book!

---

As soon as I saw this arrived I grabbed a copy for myself and practically ran to the front desk to buy it. You might know Peter Brown from his great picture books, (which include [Curious Garden](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316015479), [Mr. Tiger Goes Wild](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316200639), [My Teacher is a Monster (No I'm Not)](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316070294), and many more) but this book is very special because it's Brown's debut into middle grade! I could go on all day about how VERY VERY much I love this book. In fact, [we all could](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/kidsmith/2016/03/10/what-were-missing/). But all you need to know is this:

Robots, wildlife, adventure, illustrations (by Peter Brown of course!) and a WHOLE lot of heart are in this book. Seriously, check it out.&nbsp;

[Booked by Kwame Alexander](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780544570986)&nbsp;(Middle Grade)

---

Kwame Alexander knocked us out with his Newbery Award winning novel [The Crossover](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780544107717).&nbsp;*Booked* is about soccer star Nick Hall. So many kids are looking for books about sports and it is SUCH a pleasure to put Alexander's books in their hands and know that they are not only going to read a book on a topic they want, but they are also going to read some incredible literature. Alexander is a master of the novel-in-verse and in *Booked* he's giving us so much more than a "sports story." He is giving us a diverse novel full of REAL LIFE. Not reality stretched a bit to make a good story, but a story that feels like you lived a day in someone else's shoes.
