This is probably not uncommon among booksellers, but when I was a kid, I loved to read. Books were the constant object of my adoration, one of the only things I couldn't (can't) stop myself from bringing home in quantities with the ceaseless intensity of a bird lining its nest. I dragged home slippery stacks of Mylared library books, lingered wistfully in the children's sections of (the first, and when I was small, only) Borders and [Nicola's Books](http://www.nicolasbooks.com/). I trawled through the ten cent kids' books at Friends of the Library book sales. I wrote a lot of stories that sound incredibly familiar if you have read anything by Lois Lowry or E. Nesbit.&nbsp;

I was not a reading prodigy, just a book lover. I was voracious, but measured, and I almost never skipped ahead of my age bracket (as many, many young readers do). Maybe that's just because of the kind of kid I was, taking things one step at a time, but I also never felt discontented with the books that had been written for people my age. I had the privilege of being raised by a children's librarian who really knew her stuff, and I will tell you something: when you live with a person who can reach past the kitchen table and pull down an armload of a hundred years' worth of treasures, you do not feel quite so pressed to look ahead to something else. I'm ever mindful of what a gift it was to be raised, loving books, yes, but children's books in&nbsp;*particular*. Now, as another adult who makes children's books their career, I am happy every day to have hung on tight to that love.

Nora and Delia Ephron (both adult authors), once wrote a really charming movie that was kind of about Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan finding love, but was mostly about books. In *You've Got Mail*, Meg Ryan owns an independent children's book store in New York. The bookstore tragically doesn't last (and neither did AOL and the BEZZEETTT WOOOOOO dialup noise). But Kathleen Kelly, my fictional future self, survived with her love for children's books passionately intact.

"When you read a book as a child," she says, "it becomes a part of your identity in a way that no other reading in your whole life does."

And it's true. The books we read as kids are about us. They're for us. We take them into our hearts and make them belong to us with our ferocious need to find out who we are and build ourselves a way to see the world. Once we're older, maybe fewer books will change us in that way (although surely some will), but we'll still remember our childhood reading, and we still have things to learn and love in books for children.

<br>This week is the nationally honored&nbsp;[Children's Book Week](http://www.bookweekonline.com/about). This week, we would like to celebrate children's books. We'd like to dig through our memories and shine a light on our new favorites. We'd like to acknowledge the wonderful things that exist in children's literature, and its huge variety, and its great worth. You'll find posts here on the blog all week, and a display of staff favorites back in the kids' section.
<br>
<br>Here is something I can't forget, from Kate DiCamillo's 2004 Newbery acceptance speech for her novel&nbsp;[*The Tale of Despereaux*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763680893). (You can find the whole speech in that year's September/October issue of *Horn Book Magazine*, if you can reach back that far, or in the anthology&nbsp;*In the Words of the Winners*.)

Kate, describing a regretted act by her four-year-old self, says:
<br>
<br>"…there are people who believe that stories for children should not have darkness in them. There are people who believe that children know nothing of darkness…Children's hearts, like our hearts, are complicated. And children need, just as we do, stories that reflect the truth of their own experience of being human. That truth is this: we all do battle with the darkness that is inside of us and outside of us. Stories that embody this truth offer great comfort because they tell us we do not do battle alone."
<br>
<br>There. That's it. That's one of the reasons that children's books matter.
