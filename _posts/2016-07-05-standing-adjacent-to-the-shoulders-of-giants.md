![](/uploads/versions/paragraph---x----817-472x---.jpg)Thanks to the Improper Bostonian for naming us [Boston's Best Bookstore](https://www.improper.com/bostons-best/goods-services/bookstore-brookline-booksmith1?platform=hootsuite), and to everyone who voted us [Best Independent Bookstore](https://www.bestofboston.com/winner/best-bookstore-independent/brookline-booksmith/) on Boston.com! Make no mistake, we love ourselves, too. But we realize that what sustains us and pushes us to be better each year is the deep-rooted literary culture in this amazing corner of the world. In short, we are but one island in an archipelago. Here's to our indie sisters and brothers: Harvard Bookstore, Porter Square Books, Trident, Newtonville Books, New England Mobile Book Fair, Papercuts, JP, and all the brave purveyors of the written word in a world of zeroes and ones.

This morning we got together anyone who ever worked at Booksmith, going all the way back to 1961, and we organized a massive [Viking clap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBE6uT1QE6k&amp;sns=fb) in appreciation of all those great bookstores. Booksellers aren't really known for our rhythm and certainly not our conformity, so I hope you can appreciate how difficult that proved to be.

Here's a few must reads/listens: a public radio piece on the importance of the late [Eli Wiesel](https://news.wgbh.org/2016/07/05/local-news/facing-history-elie-wiesels-impact-educational-nonprofit) to one Brookline organization; a new [George Saunders](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/11/george-saunders-goes-to-trump-rallies) essay which you might want to avoid if you are on a strict no-presidential-campaign-stuff diet; and that passage featured up there, from Max Porter's [Grief is the Thing with Feathers](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781555977412). Join our [Book Club](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-07/book-club/) when they meet up on Tuesday evening at 7:30 to talk about it.
<br>
<br>And it's July, which means that Waldo is hiding in a bunch of Brookline businesses. [Click here](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-07/wheres-waldo--party/) to find out where you can start your search, and be sure to come to our big *Where's Waldo?* party at the end of the month!

<br>Thanks for reading,
