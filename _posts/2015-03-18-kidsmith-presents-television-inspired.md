<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">We're obsessed. It's all we can think about. It's all we talk about. It's all I'm going to blog about today: Reign. CW's drama about Mary, Queen of Scots is a show a few of us children's booksellers discovered and fell in love with. Naturally after we watched all available episodes we sought out other ways to feed our obsession in the form of books. Thus, it has inspired a new monthly feature on the blog brought to you by the kidsmith booksellers. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Television Inspired Literature will go up once a month. We know first hand that book lovers can also be TV lovers and want to share our obsessions with you. Based on popular TV shows, we've come up with some YA book titles that you might enjoy if you like the show. If you have any suggestions for TV shows we should feature or books we may have missed let us know in the comments! </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Without further ado may I present the first Television Inspired Literature: </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-APp2e0KC184/VQYahSYzv4I/AAAAAAAAAQQ/g5TkrlsnIoU/s1600/YA%2BBOOK%2BREC.jpg" height="640" width="480" /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div>
