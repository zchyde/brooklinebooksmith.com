Funny, lively, and unafraid of being a little bit complicated, <i>Tomboy</i> is a great book for anyone who questions (or wants to question) the rules of gender. We have it shelved in adult Graphica, but it's appropriate for middle school and up.<br /><br />And, by the way, this is not the only book about gender-nonconformity that we have for young readers. Here are a few others if you're looking for<b> </b>kids' books that put the<b> </b>T in LGBT.<br /><b><br /><br />FIVE TRANSGENDER BOOKS FOR KIDS AND YOUNG ADULTS</b><br /><br />1. <b>I Am Jazz by Jessie Herthel and Jazz Jennings</b> is the picture-book story of one of the most recognized transgender youth in America--Jazz Jennings, whose parents supported her early-childhood transition. This is a good introduction to what it means to be transgender for very young readers. You can find it on our picture book wall and in the kids' Life Experiences section.<br /><br />2. <b>Gracefully Grayson by Ami Polonsky</b> is a sweet, smart, sensitively written new midgrade novel about a transgender gradeschooler who is just starting to understand her own gender. Supported by school theater and a community of loving teachers and friends, Grayson takes the first brave steps into visible life as the girl she is. This is an AWESOME book.<br /><br />3. <b>Beautiful Music for Ugly Children by Kirstin Cronin-Mills<i> </i></b>is a young adult novel about a trans highschooler who (for now) only publicly lives his male identity on the air of his radio show.<br /><br />4. and 5. <b>Some Assembly Required by Arin Andrews</b> and <b>Rethinking Normal by Katie Rain Hill<i> </i></b>are memoirs of transition by a young man and woman, respectively. They can both be found in the biography section of our nonfiction wall.<br /><br /><br />Happy reading!<br />
