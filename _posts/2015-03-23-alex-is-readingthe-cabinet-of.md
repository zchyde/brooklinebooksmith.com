This is one of those books that I've thought about picking up over and over, and when I finally started reading it I kicked myself--why didn't I read it earlier?! **The Cabinet of Curiosities** is basically a game where four authors come up with a topic (fairies! cake! love!) and then take turns telling horrible stories about it. IT'S GREAT. Our four authors are Stefan Bachmann (**The Peculiar**), Claire Legrand (**Winterspell**), Katherine Catmull (**Summer and Bird**) and Emma Trevayne (**Coda**), and they serve up a delicious three dozen short stories that will give you the creeping and excellent sensation of reading **Roald Dahl** crossed with **Coraline**.  

If after you've finished that you should want more spine-tinglers, try some of these--  

**WELL, THAT WAS TERRIFYING!**

**some satisfyingly scary books for kids and young adults**

**The Diviners** by Libba Bray -- (YA)It's Evie's flapper tendencies that get her in trouble, not her possible psychic powers--until she lands in New York just as a ghostly serial murderer begins a terrifying spree across the city.

**Heap House** by Edward Carey -- In a vast mansion surrounded by a sea of garbage, our hero hears the haunting whispers of inanimate objects that can only desperately speak their human names.

**Seventh Son**by Joseph Delaney -- I mentioned the Last Apprentice series in my holiday post, but let me reiterate: HAIR-RAISING witches and adrenaline to spare.

**Coraline** by Neil Gaiman -- When your alternate universe family has buttons for eyes, you have to know something is not right. Dave McKean's spidery illustrations only add to the shivers.

**The Fall** by Bethany Griffin -- (YA) Poe's **Fall of the House of Usher** retold from the perspective of the teenage girl who lives there at the end. Do they live? Do they die?

**Wait Til Helen Comes** by Mary Downing Hahn -- (Available online & used) Molly's little stepsister isn't very nice, but at least the raging ghost she's threatening Molly with doesn't exist...right?

**Clockwork** by Phillip Pullman -- (Available online) A chilling fairy tale set in deep winter in a fictional Germany, where stories may come to life....but not everyone gets out alive.

**Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark** by Alvin Schwartz -- The absolute classic of terrifying kids' books, filled with suspenseful, ghastly legends that will haunt your dreams.

Happy reading! And keep your lights on.
