About five months ago actor/director Matt Damon found himself in hot water after the airing of his show *Project Greenlight*, a reality series where first-time filmmakers direct a feature film. The controversy surrounded an exchange between Damon and Effie Brown, the black producer of [*Dear White People*](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dear_white_people/). Brown was arguing for the importance of diversity on the movie-making set - in hiring writers, a film crew, a production team, etc. She was interrupted by Damon, who insisted that diverse casting only matters when it comes to the actors - the faces in front of the camera, not behind them. You can read a more detailed breakdown at [Vanity Fair](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/matt-damon-apology-diversity-project-greenlight-effie-brown) - suffice to say that while the fight for representation gains visibility (see the [We Need Diverse Books](http://diversebooks.org/) campaign or the [Writers of Color Database](http://www.writersofcolor.org/) for publishers), the identity of those who bring us the work is still very much at stake.

![](/uploads/versions/07jackson1-superjumbo-v4---x----1586-2048x---.jpg)ENTER: Christopher Jackson, Executive Editor at Spiegel & Grau (Random House) and one of the only major black editors in the publishing industry. If you don't know Jackson, you know his handiwork: he helmed the publication of Jay-Z's lyric collection/autobiography hybrid [*Decoded*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780812981155); Bryan Stevenson's NYT bestseller [*Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780812984965); and THE breakout title of the year, Ta-Nehisi Coates' [*Between the World and Me*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780812993547) (which, despite coming out more than halfway through 2015, skyrocketed into [our 25 top-selling books](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/2016/01/01/top-25-books-of-2015/)). The NYT [just ran an in-depth profile on Jackson](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/magazine/how-chris-jackson-is-building-a-black-literary-movement.html?_r=0) that I highly recommend - it is both a testament to his groundbreaking career and a reminder of how far we, as an industry, have to go.
