And Huckleberry Finn.<br />One was designed to be amended with the passage of time, the other meant to be a portrait of a very specific time.  Some things are meant to change, and others to remain the same.<br /><br />The past did happen, and replacing a few words in a novel won't change it.  What will change is the remarkable ability of this novel to bring the past to life for the reader.<br /><br />The Constitution does not exist to be rolled up and used as a weapon.  It is not a flag to wave over the heads of the ascendant political party.  <br /><br />When you alter Huck Finn you engage in censorship.<br />Huck Finn belongs to Mark Twain.<br /><br />When you read aloud the Constitution as if the "other side" has forsaken its meaning, you are taking a step towards a civil war.<br />The Constitution belongs to everyone.
