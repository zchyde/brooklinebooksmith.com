Graphic novels are BOOMING here at the Booksmith. And not only the Children's Graphic novels either.

But today Children's is our focus.

Specifically kick-butt lady 'centric I'm-not-helpless graphic novels. Which are not just for girls by the way.

So.

Let's start with *[Lumberjanes](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781608866878)*by Noel Stevenson, Grace Ellis, and Brooke Allen

Lumberjanes is like the Girl Scout camp we all really wish we went to. It is for HARDCORE LADY TYPES ONLY which is a good thing because our gang gets caught up in some rather fishy activities. Wrestling sea monsters from a canoe, running into some emo yetis, and saving those helpless Boy Scouts when they foolishly get brainwashed.

Noel Stevenson also wrote and illustrated&nbsp;***[Nimona](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062278227)***which is one of my favorite stand-alone graphic novels.

---

![](/uploads/versions/nimona---x----267-400x---.jpg)There is so much going on in this story. *Nimona* is a shapeshifter who isn't quite sure she likes herself. When you think you're a monster how could you? I love this character - she is so relatable and we all, at one point or another, face the questions she is asking herself. If you want a graphic novel you will read again and again, and can have a great conversation about, you should definitely check out this book.

A little less known, the graphic novel series [***Nausicaa: of the Valley of the Wind*by Hayao Miyazaki**](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781591164081) is just breathtaking.

---

![](/uploads/versions/nausicaa-volume-1-cover-1591164087---x----212-300x---.jpg)Most people know Miyazaki best from his incredible animated movies (*Spirited Away*, *Princess Mononoke*, *Ponyo*, *My Neighbor Totoro*). Miyazaki did make Nausicaa into a full length movie (which I LOVE) but he also hand illustrated and wrote all 7 volumes of Nausicaa's story. The graphic novels go much deeper into the environmental destruction of the world, and really brings Nausicaa herself to even more vivid life. As far as strong heroines go, she is at the top of my list.

"The story Disney should have been telling for the past twenty years" - [***Comics Alliance***](http://comicsalliance.com/)

This beautiful quote graces the cover of ***[Princeless Vol 1 by Jeremy Whitley and M. Goodwin](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781939352545),***&nbsp;and I could not agree with it more.

First off: diverse characters! Secondly, no damsels in distress! Third, practical armor! Which leads to one of my favorite Princeless moments: when Adrienne (pictured on the cover) goes in search of armor and well… these two snippets should give you an idea of how she reacts:

So. Brilliant. The humor is spot-on, and the girl power is perfect. Plus, it only gets better as the story goes on!

---

Lastly, I have to give [Marvel](http://marvel.com/) a big high five. I am so proud to champion their new [*Marvel Now!*](http://marvel.com/comics/events/311/marvel_now) stories. This is a great bunch series for both kids and adults. What could be better than super heroine (or hero) series that the entire family gets a kick out of?

Yup, I am head over heels in love with Kamala Khan!

The new ***[Ms Marvel](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780785190219)*[by G Willow Wilson and Adrian Alphona](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780785190219)** is just perfect as far as I'm concerned. Religion, friends, school, overbearing parents (who we love anyway), action, adventure… you name it Ms Marvel has it.
