Rumaan Alam's debut novel is the perfect read for a long day at the beach.&nbsp; Set in glittering Manhattan,&nbsp;*Rich and Pretty* follows the lives of two women from their coming of age into their adult lives.&nbsp; As the characters grow and change Alam annotates the intricacies of maintaining friendships over time and distance. Mr. Alam's effortless dialogue between the two women is uncanny – you can hear him discuss this and more in his interview with [NPR.](https://www.npr.org/2016/06/12/481750650/-rich-and-pretty-author-rumaan-alam-captures-lives-very-different-from-his-own)

*Rich and Pretty* is the epitome of a summer book – what's summer for if not for catching up with old friends, sharing secrets under the stars, and growing (whether together or apart)?

Deborah Levy is well known for her novel *Swimming Home* which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize in 2012. &nbsp;This time she takes her audience to white beaches of southern Spain. &nbsp; The hot sands and cool waters look tantalizing – but their truth is devastating. &nbsp;Levy's novel exposes things both beautiful and strange all the while exploring themes of exile, desire, and total abandon – it's intoxicating.

Jessi Klein – well known for her work with comedian Amy Schumer – writes a side-splitting autobiography in *You'll Grow Out Of It*.&nbsp; Klein hilariously addresses the ins and outs of being an outsider with this collection of admissions and mistakes.&nbsp; Klein asks the question, "What becomes of a tomboy who grows up?" with wit and grace. Her answer to this question is so funny because it's true.
