Ever judge a book by its cover?
<br>They say not to do such a thing but everyone does.

Artists and designers are constantly challenging themselves to create covers that will entice and inspire readers everywhere – all the while attempting to capture the essence of the book itself.

<br>Since the late 80s Chip Kidd and John Gall have taken on the considerable challenge of designing covers for the books world famous Japanese novelist [Haruki Murakami](http://www.harukimurakami.com/). They've been hailed for their unique mosaic creations made from vintage Japanese ephemera and prints like this one:

[South of the Border, West of the Sun](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780679767398)
<br>---
<br>In an [interview](http://www.harukimurakami.com/resource_category/q_and_a)&nbsp;designer John Gall reveals that the inspiration for the cover came from (literally) piecing together some of Murakami's recurring themes and images – running water, disappearing women, random holes in the ground, and music.
<br>John Gall has since redesigned Murakami's paperback titles with a very different look.

[Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780804170123)
<br>---
<br>The colorful cover seems insignificant but, upon closer investigation, you can see that random lines and shapes come together in the form of a geometric puzzle.

<br>John Gall talks&nbsp;[about](http://www.harukimurakami.com/resource_category/q_and_a) the book cover design stating

> "I wanted the covers to be both bold and quiet at the same time. Colorful and full…yet with a deeper mysterious resonance."

<br>The seemingly mundane reveals itself to be more complicated and very connected. &nbsp;This is a singular truth reflected in every Murakami novel. &nbsp;The connection between the plain and the fantastic is a subtle and always critical part of Murakami's storytelling.

<br>Gall overcame the epic challenge and once again designed covers that are both appealing and reflective of the author's dreamlike style.

On his writing Murakami [says](http://www.harukimurakami.com/resource_category/q_and_a/questions-for-haruki-murakami-about-kafka-on-the-shore),

> "Writing a novel lets me intentionally dream while I’m still awake. I can continue yesterday’s dream today, something you can’t normally do in everyday life…I think people who share my dreams can enjoy reading my novels"

<br>If that doesn't tell you what you need to know about Murakami's incredible books, well, I don't know what will.

Look out for Murakami's new collection of essays coming this Fall.
