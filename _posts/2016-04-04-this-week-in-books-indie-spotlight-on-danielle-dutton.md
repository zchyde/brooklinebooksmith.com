My first glimpse of Margaret Cavendish came in the Spring of 2011 at the University of Maine. Danielle Dutton was giving a reading for the [New Writing Series](https://nwsnews.wordpress.com/) from her manuscript in progress, a memoiresque novel of the Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. I was floored by the musicality of Dutton's language and the electric impulse of her heroine's romanticism - a gift for prose very much in the vein of Virginia Woolf, I would reflect five years later with the published work, [*Margaret the Firs*t](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781936787357), finally in hand.

*New York Times* reviewer Katharine Grant [heralded Dutton](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/03/books/review/danielle-duttons-margaret-the-first.html) for "expertly [capturing] the pathos of a woman whose happiness is furrowed with the anxiety of ­underacknowledgment," and Michele Filgate drew the same parallel that I did re: her predecessor [last month for the LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/books/la-ca-jc-danielle-dutton-20160313-story.html):

> [Virginia Woolf] was at the center of the Bloomsbury literary scene and began an independent publishing house out of her home with her husband, Leonard Woolf. The writer and publisher Danielle Dutton follows in Woolf's footsteps. After working at the independent Dalkey Archive Press, Dutton founded her own small press in 2010 with her husband, Martin Riker. Called Dorothy, a publishing project, it upends typical expectations and releases just two books a year, both in the fall. All, save one, have been by women.

And now we get to the crux of my Dutton obsession: her ground-breaking work as a publisher. In the years since first hearing her read, I've been following the release of gem after gem by [Dorothy, a publishing project](http://dorothyproject.com/books-gallery/):

> Dorothy, a publishing project is dedicated to works of fiction or near fiction or about fiction, mostly by women. Each fall, we publish two new books simultaneously. We work to pair books that draw upon different aesthetic traditions, because a large part of our interest in literature lies in its possibilities, its endless stylistic and formal variety.

Relative to its size, Dorothy is a giant in the publishing world, printing debuts like the lauded [*Fra Keeler*](http://dorothyproject.com/?post_type=book&amp;p=86) by Azareen Van der Vliet Oloomi and [*The Wallcreeper*](http://dorothyproject.com/?post_type=book&amp;p=55) by Nell Zink (whose second book, [*Mislaid*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062364784), was scooped up by Ecco Publishing and longlisted for the National Book Award). Dorothy's latest release, the slim and striking story collection *Vertigo* by Joanna Walsh, graces both the Booksmith shelves and the top of my to-read list. Consider picking up a copy when you rush into the store for *Margaret the First*.
