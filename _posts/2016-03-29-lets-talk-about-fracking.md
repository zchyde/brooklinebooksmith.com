April is Earth Month – with one certain date, April 22, set aside for special eco-celebrations.&nbsp; It’s an important time of year to explore various conservation initiatives and environmental concerns, such as hydraulic fracturing, better known as "fracking.”&nbsp; The Merriam-Webster Dictionary [defines](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fracking) fracking as “the injection of fluid into shale beds at high pressure in order to free up petroleum resources (such as oil or natural gas).”&nbsp; For further investigations into this hot eco-topic, check out some of the books listed below and then come on in to Booksmith and grab one, reserve a copy on the phone, or [shop online](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/site)!

The process of fracking uses lots of water.&nbsp; Many people are concerned about this, and about how much water might be contaminated by fracking techniques.&nbsp; Andrew Nikiforuk exposes these concerns in [Slick Water](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781771640763).&nbsp; This book tells the story of Jessica Ernst’s battle with the Encana Energy company.&nbsp; Ernst, a biologist and oil patch consultant, discovers that her own drinking water has become contaminated by fracking practices, and seeks justice for her community.&nbsp; Nikiforuk uses Ernst’s story as the groundwork for his search for truth in a controversial energy market.&nbsp; Nikiforuk, a journalist who has won the Rachel Carson Environmental Book Award, among others, has worked tirelessly to make known the connections among fracking, small communities, and the global economy.
