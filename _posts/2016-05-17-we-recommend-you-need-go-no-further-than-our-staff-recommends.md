A sun-drenched&nbsp;[ghost story](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781936787432). A network of [twisting tales](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780142416723)&nbsp;from the undisputed champion of the modern short story. Sonnet, song, and narrative exploring the lives and contributions of&nbsp;[African American performers](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781940696201)&nbsp;lost to history.&nbsp;[A hero's story](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781250056092), similarly almost-lost-to-history and no less lyrical, with satisfying flights of brutal hand-to-hand combat. Want to get strictly historical? Get swept up in the wake of a giant in his field as he strides through the [ocean waves](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780061702624). Or experience a ground-breaking autobiographical novel where [life becomes art](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062394668). Get down in the [dirt](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781619025691)&nbsp;and up in the&nbsp;[clouds](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780804137119)&nbsp;with a pair of sparkling nature writing specimens.&nbsp;
<br>The next time you come in, take in the view from Booksmith's tower of staff recommended books.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Just a few more recommendations before we part ways: We only have a limited number of the [Asuka Tada](http://asukatada.com/flora)'s amazing book&nbsp;[flora](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9784864104159), so if you are heading down aisle three do yourself a favor and take a look. Fauna's most enduring element, recreated with the most fleeting expressions of flora. And then pick up&nbsp;[The Electric Pencil](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781616894542), the meticulous record of one artist's dedication in the face of supreme mental and spiritual challenge. For more on that topic, check&nbsp;[this story](http://lithub.com/how-books-are-helping-austins-homeless-community/)&nbsp;about&nbsp;[Street Lit](http://streetlit.org/), a homeless literary organization flourishing in Austin, TX, and jot down a reminder to attend our next event (date not yet set) with Boston's own version,&nbsp;[The Pilgrim](http://www.stpaulboston.org/writersgroup).
<br>
<br>Have a great week, read a lot, and take care out there. I've already gotten a sunburn.
