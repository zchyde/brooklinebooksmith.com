I just got back from a trip through Arizona, and although it was slightly marred by all of the re-election campaign signs on every street corner in Maricopa County, the landscape was repeatedly breathtaking. The Grand Canyon was really, really, seriously big, my kids always seemed to be too near the edge no matter how far away we stood, and the winding road through Sedona down to Phoenix was magnificent. Between the gawking and the driving, I finished one amazing book ([Pond](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780399575891), by Claire-Louise Bennett) and started another ([My Brilliant Friend](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781609450786)&nbsp;by Elena Ferrante). My daughter got deep into the delightful&nbsp;[Ivy & Bean](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/site/ivy%20%26%20bean)&nbsp;series, my wife spent her time with&nbsp;[Junot Diaz](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781594483295), and my son devoured Peter Brown's instant classic,&nbsp;[The Wild Robot](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316381994), before getting started on Tony DiTerlizzi's&nbsp;[WondLa](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781416983118)&nbsp;books.
<br>That's a full and satisfying vacation.&nbsp;

At bedtime the night after we returned, my son wept bitterly for the end of summer, which is still about five weeks away. Oh, time.
<br>
<br>So, what was everyone up to while I was away? Oh,&nbsp;*right.*&nbsp;I hear that our&nbsp;[Harry Potter & the Cursed Child](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781338099133)&nbsp;midnight release party was super fun? We want to thank every last witch and wizard who stayed up late with us to celebrate! Booksmith's children's books team put in a ton of brainstorming effort to come up with all of the winged keys and the Golden Snitches, the terrific costumes and decorations, as well as all of that deep cut trivia. I hope [everyone had a good time](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOElrdVg9YXyzFB9_s1YItjR2k3wZIEGvLIMCz8tEfJRXw3IyHb1m4ZKEGrAIJgoQ?key=YnpUMnlrYUlmcTVhS1B4R29pYTVXbzRsS0E0ckV3)? As someone who was here for the other midnight release parties, I'm happy that a bunch of new kids got their own chance to do it for the first time.

This week we get visits from&nbsp;[Penn Jillette](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-08/penn-jillette---presto-how-i-made-over-100-pounds-disappear-and-other-magical-tales/),&nbsp;[S.E. Grove and Tui Sutherland](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-08/s-e--grove---the-crimson-skew-the-mapmakers-trilogy-tui-sutherland---wings-of-fire-legends-darkstalker/), and&nbsp;[Brad Watson](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-08/brad-watson---miss-jane/), and new books from [Colson Whitehead](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/the-underground-railroad-by-colson-whitehead-an-essential-american-novel/2016/08/01/4bcab684-55ad-11e6-b7de-dfe509430c39_story.html)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[Jesmyn Ward](http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2016/08/02/488366739/the-fire-this-time-a-new-generation-of-writers-on-race-in-america). And just for you guys, I've got a&nbsp;[circus](http://www.openculture.com/2011/01/cirque_calder.html)&nbsp;and some really pretty&nbsp;[libraries](http://www.techinsider.io/most-beautiful-library-in-all-50-states-2016-7). No politics here, but I think that Hillary Clinton deserves something for greenlighting the design of that amazing children's library which bears her name.
