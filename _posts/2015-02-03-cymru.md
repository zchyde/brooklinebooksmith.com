The travel section has a new destination of the month! It's exciting! It's wonderful! It's Wales!

The last couple of days I have been involved in a number of conversations that have gone somewhere along the lines of:

Amy: I have to write that blog post about Wales!  
Bystander: Whales?  
Amy: Wales.  
Bystander: Why are you writing a blog post about whales?  
Amy: It's destination of the month.  
Bystander: ...what?  
Amy: Wales...Destination of the month?  
Bystander: Oh! The country!  
Amy: Why would I be writing a blog post about animal-whales?  

That is a question that no one could answer. Not that we have anything against whales. We are all pro-whale here.

Anyway.

Wales is a country of many things.

The Earliest Prose Literature in Britain:

And a language that is so beautiful that Tolkien based Elvish off of it.
(This very same language is also almost completely nonsensical to look at for an English speaker, I think so and I've been trying to learn it).

 And I'd probably get in trouble if I didn't mention they also have a rugby team:

Wales has such a wonderful mythological and literary history that it's no wonder that Britain's famous Hay-on-Wye Book Festival is right on the border of Wales and England.

It is a wonder why more people aren't more interested in Wales as literary and beautiful as it is. Well, this is your chance to come in and find some books about, set in, and written in Wales. There are so many more than fit on our small little display shelf so do some research learn about this little country with big literary influence.

So, take a minute out of your visit and wander over to the travel section to check out some books about Wales.

Hwyl fawr am nawr!
