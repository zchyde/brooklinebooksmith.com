So can I talk for a minute about reading on the T?<br /><br />For several weeks I was trying to slog through <em>Obama's Wars</em>. Nothing against the book, but it was pretty dense and not exactly the read I was expecting. But I loved carrying it on the T -- even though I disliked reading it -- because everyone would see me reading <em>Obama's Wars</em> and think, somehow, that I was erudite and political and clearly a smart lady. I remember a situation in which three men in Army fatigues got on, and I literally was so excited to convey the message that I was reading <em>Obama's Wars</em> that I tried extra-extra-hard to make my book cover visible.<br /><br />When I finished that one, it was on to <em>Living Dead in Dallas,</em> the second book in the Sookie Stackhouse vampire series. Oh boy! I am a major fan of <em>True Blood</em>, which is based on the book series, and I was itching to read the semi-trashy, pulpy novel. "But no!" I thought to myself. "The only time I have to read is on the T! I can't read <em>Living Dead in Dallas</em> on the T! People will see me! GAHHH!" Upon deciding that not reading the book was not an option, I hid the cover as best I could in my lap.<br /><br />And now I'm reading <em>Tommy's Tale</em>, the self-proclaimed "<em>Queer as Folk</em> meets <em>About A Boy</em>", which features a pair of splayed male legs falling out of a bathtub. (They're attached to said male, of course -- it's not a slasher novel -- but all you can see is the legs.) Now I feel like people are looking at my book cover and thinking that I am reading some party-hard, not-literary, trash. (I also feel this way when I come to sex scenes in books I'm reading on the T -- suddenly embarrassed and quite furtive.)<br /><br />So I was thinking about my issues with T reading, and why I was so concerned that other people would care about what I was reading. "Self," I said to myself, "when was the last time YOU noticed what someone else was reading on the T?" And the honest answer is -- never.<br /><br />So I just need to get over my reading-on-the-T complex and display my book covers proudly, whatever they may be. But I know that sometimes I may still hope that people are taking more notice of the "I Love Brookline Booksmith" pin on my bag than they are of my choice of reading material.
