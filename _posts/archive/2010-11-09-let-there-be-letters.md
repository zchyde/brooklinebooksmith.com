As the world of communication goes more and more into the ether, I'm very concerned about letters, physical letters written by one person to another.  Volumes of letters have been a big literary genre all of my 38 bookselling years and  for eons before.  What will become of them?  How will we know people and events in the unique ways available through letters written on paper and saved.  Somehow collected emails don't have the same heft and depth.  Maybe that will be okay with everyone going forward.   Not me, though.  It's not going to be okay with me.  <br /><br />I'm reminded of this concern since we just got in a new book of Saul Bellow's letters,  entitled (wait for it) "<a href="https://http//www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780670022212">Saul Bellow : Letters</a>". He has actually been a customer of ours!  This is a wonderful, enlightening volume.  I love learning the thoughts,  history, process and personal writing style of beloved authors this way.<br /><br />Herewith part of a favorite poem of my husband's.  It's from A.A. Milne's "<a href="https://http//www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780670022212">Now We Are Six</a>", a lovely little volume if you don't know it.   From "The Knight Whose Armour Didn't Squeak":<br /><br />"Of all the Knights in Appledore<br />The wisest was Sir Thomas Tom<br />He multiplied as far as four,<br />And knew what nine was taken from<br />To make eleven.  He could write<br />A letter to another Knight."<br /><br />Good job, Sir Tom!!
