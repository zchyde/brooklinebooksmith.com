I had two buying appointments today, at pretty wide ends of the spectrum--Simon and Schuster Children's in the morning, university presses in the afternoon.<br /><br />My big highlight of the morning was <strong><em><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9781416949725">The Mysterious Edge of the Heroic World</a></em></strong> by E. L. Konigsburg. We have in the store a bookcase filled with our staff "Essential Reads"--pretty much our desert island books-- and as Ms. Konigsburg's <em><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780689853548">From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler</a></em> is one of my essential reads I am super-eager for this new novel (which, like <em>From the Mixed-Up Files..,</em> also involves art and a mystery).<br /><br />As for the afternoon, Iowa is reprinting a book James Thurber published in 1939 called <em><strong><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9781587296208">The Last Flower</a></strong></em>, which is both beautiful and heart-breaking as it imagines a world destroyed by war. And Reaktion Books (distributed by University of Chicago) is adding to its wonderful <a href="https://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/series.html?id=1">series of books on animals </a>with titles dedicated to <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781861893499">swans </a>and <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&initiate=yes&amp;fromauthor=yes&author=5836671">ducks </a>(I doubt I'm the only one to appreciate that they are coming out at the same time. I wonder which one will discuss <em><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780763621599">The Ugly Duckling</a></em>?)
