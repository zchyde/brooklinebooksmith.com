There'll be a sea of tables, a flood of books, and a deluge of terrific writing circulating amongst a river of excitement. A full run down of participating presses and readings can be had <a href="https://www.chapbookfestival.org/">at their website</a>. My press, <a href="https://www.greyingghost.com">Greying Ghost</a> will be parked at table #12. We'll have a candy dish. I'll be wearing my trusted fedora.
