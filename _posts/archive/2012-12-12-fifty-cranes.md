<br /><div class="MsoNormal">Boston equals school for most people, and I’m no different.&nbsp; Each semester, people I love drift off towards new jobs and new locales, packing up their lives and shifting them elsewhere.&nbsp; I’m genuinely happy for them, but I can’t help that brief, gasping moment of sadness when they leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Yesterday, my friend Gretchen left to return to the West Coast.&nbsp; We started graduate school together, slogging through classes, discussing theories, and running into each other at random moments.&nbsp; We skipped class in October to go to the Sherman Alexie event, where I did the introduction and she was part of the sold-out audience. When she got to the front of the signing line, she mentioned that he was worth skipping class for.&nbsp; He looked up, and in his self-defacing style wrote, “You should have went to class.”&nbsp; It still makes me laugh. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Having this job means I see a lot of people on a regular basis, and a lot of my friendships have been cemented because I’ve run into people browsing the shelves or sitting down to attend an event.&nbsp; I can make an author timeline of my friendships—Colin Meloy and Carson Ellis, Jack Gantos, Mo Willems, and more—each representing a person that has played a part in my Boston life.&nbsp; </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I wrote this blog post so I could show you what Gretchen left me: a string of fifty cranes, all in different colors.&nbsp; &nbsp;I’ve hung it up in my office, lifting up the ceiling tiles to keep it there.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0GVYjMcSp5M/UMkelxTLzHI/AAAAAAAAAGo/fJkQ2Ke6H_8/s1600/photo+(4).JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0GVYjMcSp5M/UMkelxTLzHI/AAAAAAAAAGo/fJkQ2Ke6H_8/s320/photo+(4).JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal">I hate it when people leave, but if I’m lucky, they leave something beautiful behind.&nbsp; It might be a string of cranes, it might be a pile of used books that Carl and Natasha have deemed worthy for the UBC, or it might be something less material.&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Thanks for the cranes, Gretchen.&nbsp;</div>
