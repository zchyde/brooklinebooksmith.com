On super-gross rainy days I like to read engrossing take-me-far-away books. Right now I'm on <i>A Feast for Crows</i>, book 4 of the Song of Ice &amp; Fire/Game of Thrones series. Book 4 has a lot of chapters set in Dorne, the mythical southern lands of George R. R. Martin's fantasy kingdom Westeros, a land of sun and sand and the source of all good wine. Coupled with all the drama, bloodshed and intrigue of the series, it's just the ticket to transport one away from this constant rain.<br /><br /><a href="http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/012/3/a/Samurai_Rain_by_Artnaitve.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/012/3/a/Samurai_Rain_by_Artnaitve.jpg" width="145" /></a>But honestly, reading on a rainy day is a no-brainer, and no book in particular is any more alluring when it's raining out and you have a nice blanket and cup of tea inside (in my opinion). I've lived in Seattle though, where it rains 9 months of the year and if you ever use the weather for an excuse to not do something you'll never leave the house. And there's plenty of things to do in Boston given the cruddy weather! Our special orders guru Russ just scoped the Samurai! exhibit at the MFA. Nothin' like a sweet museum to get you out of the weather and into another world. It'll be like standing around in a Mishima novel or Kurosawa movie!<br /><i><br /></i><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2o76hzojgdQ/Ubsbi60_n7I/AAAAAAAABSo/RPy5zJLeGyU/s1600/bozicevic.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="188" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2o76hzojgdQ/Ubsbi60_n7I/AAAAAAAABSo/RPy5zJLeGyU/s200/bozicevic.jpg" width="200" /></a></div>Or, you could swing by the Booksmith. Load up on fantasy and samurai novels and then stick around for tonight's event. The Bash poetry series is hosting three amazing poets at 7 PM: Sampson Starkweather,&nbsp;Ana Božičević and Dan Chelotti. They're all amazing poets, totally different from each other so it will be like a smorgasbord! And nobody loves rain more than poets, right? Sorry that was a really horrible generalization. But I'm right, right?<br /><br />So there's plenty to read or do whether you let the rain get you down or not! Come see us!
