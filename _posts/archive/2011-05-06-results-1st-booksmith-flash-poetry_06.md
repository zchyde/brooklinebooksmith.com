I tell<br />him when he is older.<br />When he actually can read.<br /><br />In a flash, he is again<br />on the other side of the store.<br /><br />I glance at the other patrons,<br />sitting quietly and calmly<br />in the wooden chairs.<br /><br />I worry what they must think<br />of me,<br />letting my son destroy<br />the serenity, the peace<br />of a bookstore. I worry<br />what they must think of him,<br />the feral child of "Mad Max,"<br />raised by wolves,<br />a misbehaving demon.<br /><br />Arms loaded, I drop my<br />purchase on the counter.<br />The cashier smiles,<br />"What a wonderful child!"<br />Another coos, "What<br />great hair!"<br />"He must have so much fun!"<br /><br />And I forget my worries.<br />Cassidy holds my hand<br />as we toddle out of the store together,<br />into the sun, and on our way<br />to other adventures.<br /></div><br /><br /><br />Liz resides in Salem with her husband Ian, two year old son Cassidy, and two rabbits Sabrina and Snorbles. When she isn't entering poetry contests or working, she spends most of her time at playgrounds, yarn stores, and of course, bookstores. Her favorite poetry comes from the Romantics, and the last book she read was Kurt Vonnegut's Look at the Birdie.
