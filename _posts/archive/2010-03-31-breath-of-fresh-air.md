Turn two more pages and you will find yourself in the midst of a garden filled with beautiful blooming trees.  Soon, you will be captured into the world of Flory.  Smaller than a clump of cherry blossoms, this little demanding night fairy doesn't want anyone to enter her lonely world, unless they can give her rides on her back to wherever she demands. <br /><br />Friendship can take a lot more courage than you think you have.  Through a hummingbird's promise, a ferocious and defiant spider, one very hungry squirrel, and a few other creature-obstacles, Flora soon learns that friendship is sacrificing your needs and giving back.<br /><br />Laura Amy Schlitz's <span style="font-style: italic;">The Night Fairy</span> is a fabulous read (even more so as a read aloud) for ages 6 and up.  Without extraneous plot lines and scenes to clutter your mind around, reading<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Night Fairy</span> is like a breath of fresh air. Angela Barrett's beautiful, soft illustrations complete the world of a wondrous backyard garden hidden with danger.<br /><br />If you are a nature lover, are somewhat adventurous, or love fairies, then look no further than this beautifully packaged book put out by Candlewick Press (2010).  You can find an excerpt of the opening chapter at http://www.thenightfairy.com/#book. <br /><br />Laura Amy Schlitz is also the author of <span style="font-style: italic;">Good Masters! Sweet Ladies! Voices from a Medieval Village</span>, winner of the 2008 Newbery Award.
