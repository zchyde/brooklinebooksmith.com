It took a while for them to role in, but a few did!!! Shannon O'Connor is our winner and here is what was written on the back of her receipt!!!! I'll be sending her a gift certificate and some surprises too!</div><br />Keep an eye open for more contests (April is poetry month after all!!)<br /><br /><br />Here's our winner!<br /><br /><br /><br />A while ago, Shannon ran<br />out of books to read, so she<br />went to various used bookstores<br />to fill the void. The books, in<br />piles on the floor, decided they<br />liked each other, and started<br />procreating. Now Shannon eats<br />two books for an afternoon<br />snack with her coffee.<br />The books on the floor cry when<br />one of their sisters gets<br />swallowed. Shannon doesn't like<br />to clean, she just eats the mess.<br />She's getting thinner.
