Audiobooks are not just for the road anymore.  They are also great to use when you’re just not feeling well for whatever reason.  Let’s face it, the TV can only do so much when your head is spinning and your eyes are too tired to stare at the colorful, talking box all day.   Instead, put on an audiobook of your favorite book, sit back, and rest your eyes.   Don’t worry, there are no alterations in the script – unlike the movies “loosely” based off of a terrific novel.<br /><br />You can find some great excerpts <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/audio/listeninglibrary/">here</a> (scroll down to the Jukebox).  And as always, we’d be glad to order any for you here at the store (with no shipping charges!).  Here are some of my own favorites:<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/audio/catalog/samplepop.pperl?isbn=9780807208526">Charlotte’s Web</a></span> by E.B. White<br />What can be better that reading E.B. White’s classics?  Listening to him to read his work, of course!<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/audio/catalog/samplepop.pperl?isbn=9780739331781">Wrinkle in Time</a></span> by Madeleine L’Engle<br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Wrinkle in Time</span> is almost more magical when read aloud by the author.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.harpercollinschildrens.com/harperchildrensImages/listeningroom/9780060582531.mp3">House at Pooh Corner</a></span> by A.A. Milne (read by Jim Broadbent)<br />Tigger attacking Pooh’s tablecloth is one of the most hilarious things I’ve heard read aloud.<br /><br />Audiobooks have gotten bad rap over these years because you’re not <span style="font-style:italic;">really reading </span>the book.  But, what about hearing your favorites?  Especially when, God forbid, you can't read.  Audio is great!
