It's a wonderful classic picture book by Eve Titus titled <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780375839016"><strong><em>Anatole</em></strong> </a>(originally published in the 1950s and just as great today). If you know anyone who loved the movie <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0382932/"><em>Ratatouille</em> </a>(not just kids!)--they absolutely MUST meet Anatole, a Parisian mouse whose taste buds help the Duvall Cheese Factory become the most successful cheese producer in all of France. But all the while he must keep his identity a secret (he is a mouse, after all!)<br /><div></div><br /><div>By the way, Paul Galdone, the illustrator of <em>Anatole</em>, won <a href="https://www.ala.org/ala/alsc/awardsscholarships/literaryawds/caldecottmedal/caldecotthonors/caldecottmedal.cfm#50s">Caldecott Honors </a>for both that and its sequel, <em><strong><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780375839023">Anatole and the Cat</a></strong></em>, also written by Ms. Titus and also worth checking out. And by the way times two, Ms. Titus had a way with mice--her other best known character is Basil of Baker Street, a.k.a. the Sherlock Holmes of the Mouse World (who inspired a Disney movie of his own, <em><a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0091149/">The Great Mouse Detective</a></em>). </div><br /><div></div>
