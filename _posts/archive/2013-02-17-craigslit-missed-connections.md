<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b>Caught you&nbsp;eyeing&nbsp;the goods last week</b> - m4w (Pemberley)</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Girl, you didn't need to run off like you did. With a brain that fine, mi casa es su casa. Care to join me for a stroll round the estate? Let's ditch your sister though. Her new hubby harshes my vibe.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b>Still waiting...</b> - m4G (near a tree I think?)</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Yo Godot, this is getting ridiculous. I've never been stood up before and I don't plan on starting now so I'm here for the&nbsp;foreseeable&nbsp;future; the least you could do is text to say you're on your way. Show a little hustle, please; the suspense is killing me.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b>I asked for amour not a moor </b>- m4w (your place, Yorkshire)&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Babe we could have had it all and then you had to go and die. I gotta say, that really grinds my gears. Now I'm stuck at the back end of nowhere, bored as all get-out and brooding like there's no tomorrow. BTW your family is insufferable. Wish you'd swing by; ghost lovin' beats nothing at all. I'll leave the window open.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b>At the altar, eons ago </b>- w4m (Satis House)</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">More like Saddest House, am I right? Our wedding cake gathers dust on the table and some scruffy orphan keeps hitting on my daughter. Still can't get you out of my head. Even now the unquenchable thirst for vengeance surges through my body like a bilious tide... oh but I can't stay mad at you. Let's start over. I'm already in my dress + veil and good to go. This time, buddy, you sign the pre-nup.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b>Sea captain seeks his one and only</b> - m4wh (Melville, USA)</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Me: tyrannical, hard-bitten, one peg leg.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">You: white, aquatic, and kind of a Dick.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Can I buy you a drink? The Harpoon IPA is quite good...</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">(Cheat sheet: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice" target="_blank">1</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_For_Godot" target="_blank">2</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuthering_Heights" target="_blank">3</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Expectations" target="_blank">4</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick" target="_blank">5</a>)</span>
