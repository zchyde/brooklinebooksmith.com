In case you're curious--yes, Tedy Bruschi truly is amazingly kind, humble, considerate, and all-around-awesome. I didn't think it was possible, but I'm even more of a fan now than I was 48 hours ago. </div><br /><div></div><br /><div>After the official signing yesterday for his book, <strong><em><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9780470108697">Never Give Up: My Stroke, My Recovery &amp; My Return to the NFL</a></em></strong>, while he was in our back room signing some special orders and extra stock, Mr. Bruschi chatted with some of us Brookline Booksmithies about what we had been reading recently and challenged us to come up with some recommendations for him, which was lots of fun for all of us (and hopefully for him as well!). </div><br /><div></div><br /><div>If you'd like to join the Tedy Bruschi book club, here are the titles we picked out (the first by yours truly) that may find their way into his carry-on luggage this season:</div><br /><ul><br /><li><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9780812973013"><em><strong>Mountains Beyond Mountains</strong></em> </a>by Tracy Kidder </li><br /><li><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780393330472"><em><strong>Blind Side</strong></em> </a>by Michael Lewis</li><br /><li><em><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9781596912373"><strong>Restless</strong> </a></em>by William Boyd and</li><br /><li><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780679730347"><em><strong>London Fields</strong></em> </a>by Martin Amis</li></ul><br /><p>And as if I couldn't be any more impressed, Mr. Bruschi also got guy bonus points for thinking to ask us for a book for his wife as well! I gave him <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781400098071"><strong><em>The Myth of You and Me</em></strong> </a>by Leah Stewart, and I hope she enjoys it--it's one of my all-time favorites.</p>
