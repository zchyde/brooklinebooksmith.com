Duckling asks for what he wants and gets it?&nbsp; That's just unfair.&nbsp; The ending has&nbsp;a little different spin than most of the Pigeon books, but I won't ruin the experience for you when you read it for the first time.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Tickets are flying faster than this pigeon would ever think to fly, so don't put it off.&nbsp; Give us a call at 617-566-6660.<br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">The event is Sunday, April 1st at 10:30 a.m. at the Coolidge Corner Theatre.&nbsp; Tickets are free, however the limit is four per person.&nbsp; And for all children's events, we ask that children under 12 be accompanied with an adult at all times.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div>*You may notice that this book is not due out until April 3rd.  Well, we have special permission from the publisher to release it <u>two days early</u> for our event. (Now that's a deal Amazon can't get you! -- nor can they bring you awesome authors live and in person.)
