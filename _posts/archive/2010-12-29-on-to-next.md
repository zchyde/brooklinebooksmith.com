Hard to believe another Christmas has come and gone.&nbsp; It's an odd time  of year here in a bookstore.&nbsp; New titles of the year are barely budding  among the collaged shelves of classics and yesterday's reads.&nbsp; Holiday shopping has dwindled down.&nbsp; Restocking the shelves won't feel like a running a marathon for a while.&nbsp; Usually were so focused on what's up and coming  that it's nice to relax back into the old favorites for the time being.&nbsp;  This week, I finally had time to leisurely read my favorite holiday picturebooks.&nbsp; I think I melted into the couch and lost myself between the  pages; it was a great experience.&nbsp; Excuse the cliche, but it was like  spending time with old friends, as you loose yourself in a memory that's right in front of you.&nbsp; And, for a moment, all is good and peaceful.<br /><br />I hope that you will revisit old favorites, while the snow is thick outside, as well.
