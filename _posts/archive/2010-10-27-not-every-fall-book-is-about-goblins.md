Halloween is right around the corner! October always goes by way to fast for me, but I can't let it get away without sharing more fall recs with you. I already introduced you to <a href="http://brooklinebooksmith.blogspot.com/2010/09/i-smell-goodness-approaching-d.html">Fletcher</a>, now it's time for Gianna.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TMiPeT5aJ-I/AAAAAAAAALk/_WsHQAUxAjE/s1600/brilliant-fall.jpg"><img style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; WIDTH: 131px; FLOAT: right; HEIGHT: 200px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5532829893124564962" border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TMiPeT5aJ-I/AAAAAAAAALk/_WsHQAUxAjE/s200/brilliant-fall.jpg" /></a><br />Gianna enjoys running through leaves, not collecting them as homework. And, her procrastination habits aren't exactly helping her. But if she doesn't collect all 25 of her New England leaves and identify them, she will not be able to compete in the upcoming track meet. <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780802721730">The Brilliant Fall Gianna Z</a></em> is the quintessential fall book. Kate Messner's imagery of autumn is stunning and her way of describing people through what kind of tree they are is, indeed, brilliant. This book is great to read year round, but even more so in the middle of fall as the leaves change and fall right outside of your window.<br /><br />More eye catching Halloween and autumnish titles:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781416935759"><em>Halloween Kid</em></a> by Rhode Motijo<br />This western style tale leaves no room for hooligan ghosts, vampires, or werewolves. When non-candy items are being handed out, the kids think that Halloween might be on its way to being canceled for good. Halloween Kid can solve this problem on his own...or, maybe not. Join the Halloween Kid and trick-or-treaters as they band together against menacing goblins to keep Halloween safe for all -- with candy, too.<br /><br /><em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780312608866">Ghosts in the House </a></em>by Kazuna Kohara<br />This ghost story picturebook is like no other. I'll just say there are no scary ghosts roaming round this story, but this little witch girl has a mind of her own. After she catches these ghosts, she puts them through the washer, hangs them out to dry, and on the story goes. Charming and resourceful, Kohara only uses three colors -- orange, black, and white -- and is very deserving of the 2008 NYT Best Illustrated Book award.<br /><br /><em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763639662">AlphaOops: H is for Halloween</a></em> by Alethea Kontis<br />Why is the alphabet always told in the same old format: first the a, then the b, then along comes the c? As long as all of the letters are there, it's still the alphabet, right? Join these letters as they put on a show for Halloween...dressed up in costume to their own costumed themes.<br /><br /><em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781426305825">Seed Sprout Pumpkin Pie</a></em> by Jill Esbaum<br />Here is a great non-fiction Halloween and autumn book. It's all about pumpkins. This book shows how a pumpkin grows and how different people use them -- from jack-o-lantern carvings, to giant boats, to kitchen delights. It's the whole squash family! "Have you picked your pumpkin?"<br /><br /><em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780486476827">Leaves of the Season: Stained Glass Coloring Book</a> </em>by Ruth Soffer<br />Leaves are beautiful to watch, but what about making your own and hanging them on the window? This book provides a great indoor activity for oneself or a group of friends. It's not just for fall, but every season of the year. With 16 different leaves to color and explore, better go grab your markers!<br /><br />Happy Autumn!
