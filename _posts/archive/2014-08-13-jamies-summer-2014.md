This summer has gone by in a flash. Maybe it was the reappearance of the polar vortex, reducing the nights I fell asleep with my face pressed against my a/c unit dramatically. Maybe it was because I started being excited about summer at the end of April. Maybe it was actually a short summer.<br /><br />A lot of things squeezed themselves into this summer. I had a week-long vacation. My events team and I won <a href="http://www.bostonmagazine.com/best-of-boston/2014/brookline-booksmith-12/" target="_blank">Boston Magazine's Best of Boston 2014 Best Reading Series</a>. I discovered the joy of having an undercut when it is humid outside. I lost my office key at least 20 times. I bought a bird from the JFK Presidential Library and Museum gift shop. Garrison Keillor rubbed my hair. I read at least 30, if not 40 books this summer. I discovered how wonderful Elizabeth Gilbert is. I went to the beach. I planned our fall event calendar. I had a good time.<br /><br />I'll end this with my submission for the Booksmith Staff Talent Show. I wrote a sestina about spatial reasoning and filmed myself in my parents' backyard in the Southwest. It was 107 degrees outside, and I would have done more takes if I thought I could survive any longer. My siblings helped out by showing off their skills (my sister is especially brilliant at it but not when she's trying really hard not to laugh), and poetic magic was born. Enjoy.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOG_video_class" id="BLOG_video-81726b943fab8054" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/get_player"><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"><param name="flashvars" value="flvurl=http://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?id%3D81726b943fab8054%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1451299849%26sparams%3Did,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D7AB0BAA46F450A14F8B0ADF432E75C8AA26A5F65.BA5045998C38674F7A47DC739883DBDAE09497C0%26key%3Dck2&amp;iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3D81726b943fab8054%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DGPiGc0hh8LTKIA0SlkhE-Ka1I10&amp;autoplay=0&amp;ps=blogger"><embed src="//www.youtube.com/get_player" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="320" height="266" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" flashvars="flvurl=http://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?id%3D81726b943fab8054%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1451299849%26sparams%3Did,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D7AB0BAA46F450A14F8B0ADF432E75C8AA26A5F65.BA5045998C38674F7A47DC739883DBDAE09497C0%26key%3Dck2&iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3D81726b943fab8054%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DGPiGc0hh8LTKIA0SlkhE-Ka1I10&autoplay=0&ps=blogger" allowFullScreen="true" /></object></div><br />
