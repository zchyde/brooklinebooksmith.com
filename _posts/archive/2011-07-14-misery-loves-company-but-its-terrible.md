I had an awful and exhausting day today and I'm too exhausted to write anything here, my dearest internet surfers.  <br /><br />This is all I really want you to look at right now: <a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/article/6564693/what-youre-reading-at-every-stage-of-your-life">What You Will Be Reading At Every Stage of Your Life</a> (caution: some mildly spicy language involved. Ask an adult for assistance, kids!)<br /><br />Also, be careful what you read in the laundromat. I just totally alienated myself by reading "A Stolen Life" stuck in a dreary room with a bunch of monotonous machines. The book is plenty alienating itself, (a real life Emma Donaghue's "Room") you don't need to mix it with the boundless ennui of laundry.<br /><br />I'm going to go drink champagne on a balcony now. It's a thing I gotta do.<br /><br />Night Brookline.
