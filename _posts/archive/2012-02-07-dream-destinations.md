He was walking on top of the water there, looking down at the fish swimming below. "Why Haiti?" I asked. He wasn't sure, but apparently the night before that, Ric's subconcious took him to Chile.<br /><br />"Hey," Ric said,&nbsp;"it's cheaper than flying."<br /><br />For the rest of us who can't afford the airfare, for those of us with a less inventive subconscious who can't depend on the thrift of&nbsp;dreamworld travel, there's Destination Literature.<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JKZcVKVLnF8/Ty6p1MLgeqI/AAAAAAAAAU8/zPkYfAyG8ZU/s1600/mauritius.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="164" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JKZcVKVLnF8/Ty6p1MLgeqI/AAAAAAAAAU8/zPkYfAyG8ZU/s200/mauritius.jpg" width="200" /></a>If you haven't visited this relatively new section at Booksmith, and if the fresh springlike air of our uncommonly warm first of February&nbsp;had you restless to go somewhere new, check out the literature there, shelved geographically, and if not cheaper than a good dream-filled night's sleep, at least you won't have to pay for the hotel.<br /><br />
