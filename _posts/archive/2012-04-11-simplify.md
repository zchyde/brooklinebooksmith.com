Showed the mouse to the magpie:<br /><br />When you have nothing, it's okay to have more.&nbsp; But be content with that.&nbsp; You don't need multiple places of stuff or hoards of things lying around.&nbsp; When too much stuff breaks your nest, it's more than enough.&nbsp; When the purpose becomes solely&nbsp;getting more, it's more than enough.&nbsp; It may be hard getting rid of so much stuff, but in the end, having "not much at all" is quite enough.&nbsp; <br /><br />Life is not stuff, it's living with the creatures around you.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dhSQMoKT8vM/T4YUDjNKx5I/AAAAAAAAAWI/4bZPd33W3fw/s1600/more.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="321" qda="true" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dhSQMoKT8vM/T4YUDjNKx5I/AAAAAAAAAWI/4bZPd33W3fw/s400/more.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>
