Can you believe that Thanksgiving is a week from tomorrow?  While looking at our Thanksgiving table -- complete with books, little turkeys, chocolates, and more -- I noticed that I've never read many Thanksgiving books.  The holiday comes and goes so fast with even bigger ones coming up that they have always escaped.  I must admit that holiday books, for the most part, are either great or just <i>eh</i>.  I was surprised at a few books though.  <br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TOR_rHA-o-I/AAAAAAAAAME/xZxQdDmV2uY/s1600/9780060537111_0_Cover.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TOR_rHA-o-I/AAAAAAAAAME/xZxQdDmV2uY/s200/9780060537111_0_Cover.jpg" width="132" /></a></div><br />The first, <i><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780060537111">It's Thanksgiving</a></i>, by Jack Prelutsky, which is a great book of poems.  Whether you are a person who can't eat on Thanksgiving or has over-eaten, for watchers of football and parades, right down to the repetition of leftovers, there is a poem for everyone in this book and they were all fun to read, too.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TOSAbwDBqaI/AAAAAAAAAMI/i1I6KMDDIgc/s1600/9780439812207_xlg.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TOSAbwDBqaI/AAAAAAAAAMI/i1I6KMDDIgc/s200/9780439812207_xlg.jpg" width="182" /></a></div><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780439812207"><i>Sarah Morton's Day</i></a>, by Katie Waters, isn't actually about Thanksgiving, but the the life of a pilgrim girl.  I liked it because it is relevant to Thanksgiving, but it gives other food for thought -- especially after reading books on the same Turkey event over and over.  Even though we live near the same soil as pilgrims here in Massachusetts, life was sure different!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TOSBEprzfbI/AAAAAAAAAMM/XtFJBuGafuQ/s1600/images.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TOSBEprzfbI/AAAAAAAAAMM/XtFJBuGafuQ/s200/images.jpg" width="137" /></a></div>"It takes all kinds of pilgrims to make a Thanksgiving."  I was glad I finally got around to reading <i><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780688162801">Molly's Pilgrim</a></i>, written by Barbara Cohen.&nbsp;  Molly is a Jewish-Russian immigrant who doesn't speak English very well.  Yet, as the first Thanksgiving nears, she learns that she too is a pilgrim.  Thanksgiving is more about feasting and peace-making; it is about finding religious freedom.<br /><br />In regards to factual books,<a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780439105668"><i> If You Were at the First Thanksgiving</i></a>, by Anne Kamma, is a great Q&amp;A book for kids who already know the ins and outs of Thanksgiving.&nbsp; Susan Sloat's  <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780448453477"><i>Pardon That Turkey</i></a> also gives a plethora of interesting facts about this November holiday we have celebrated for hundreds of years.
