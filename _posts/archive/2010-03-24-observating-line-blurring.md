twinned body language reveals a long pairing, <br /><br />circling the tables without looking, holding out <br />a book the other receives without looking <br /><br />circling and returning <br />to peer over, <br />or around  <br /><br />"which one is that now?"<br />"this, i heard good things about it"<br />"yes, i've read that, i remember he's mute, i think"<br />"you've read it?"<br />"that's right. you don't know what i'm reading anymore, <br /><br />because it's all electronic."
