Maybe it's the advent of spring, maybe it's string of boring non-fiction I've just plowed through but for some reason I got it in my head last week that I really wanted to read an engrossing novel that is just a basic love story. Something cheesy. Something simple. But something well-written. It's a hard balance to strike but here are some recommendations if you're in the mood for love, too:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PZ75iiU7SEM/UZaa2Eu8BXI/AAAAAAAABQ8/f5YJuymkRvo/s1600/roomwithaview.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PZ75iiU7SEM/UZaa2Eu8BXI/AAAAAAAABQ8/f5YJuymkRvo/s320/roomwithaview.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><b>Old Favorites</b><br /><br /><i>A Room With a View</i>. Genteel girl, social outcast boy. Will they, won't they, love triangle, Italy. This book has it all!<br /><br /><i>The Sky is Everywhere</i>. A heartbreaker of a novel where a girl's sister dies and in the wake while dealing with the grief, the protagonist deals with the seemingly ill-timed first blushes of love.<br /><br /><i>The Marriage Plot</i>. A love triangle set in the 1980s, with international travel, being in love with someone with bipolar disorder, and unrequited pining. All the good stuff with beautiful writing and super-real characters as only Eugenides can pull off.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4d-DiXh8w3U/UZaaqgW03vI/AAAAAAAABQ0/JUhgXQVk9Wg/s1600/blue,book,cover,green,ilustration,red-f272605dcc5d242fdf2d3cdbb83e4ba1_h.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4d-DiXh8w3U/UZaaqgW03vI/AAAAAAAABQ0/JUhgXQVk9Wg/s200/blue,book,cover,green,ilustration,red-f272605dcc5d242fdf2d3cdbb83e4ba1_h.jpg" width="130" /></a></div>And the pile of <b>To-Reads</b> on my nightstand after all my searching:<br /><br /><i>Delicacy</i>. A French love story in which a young widow finds an unlikely mate in a geeky guy at work.<br /><br /><i>The Lover</i>. The modernist novella in which a young French teen in Indochina has a saucy affair with a Chinese man.<br /><br /><i>Justine</i>. Basically a book set in bedrooms. Sold.<br /><br />
