<div>New staff picks were due today and as usual I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to recommend. There were A LOT from which I was trying to choose. I thought about my recent faves, <strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780385526197">Blindspot</a></em></strong>, <em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780152063962"><strong>Graceling</strong></a></em>, and then I thought about doing something a little more old-school and recommending <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780393325591"><strong><em>Cooking for Mr. Latte</em></strong> </a>or <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780767903387"><strong><em>Tender at the Bone</em></strong> </a>(there's something about the winter that just leads me to food memoirs). In honor of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/changedotgov/3169915653/in/set-72157612143267559/">Sasha and Malia </a>I thought of recommending <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780312374884"><strong><em>The President's Daughter</em></strong> </a>and I still think I might see if I can slip that in as an extra this month. </div><br /><div></div><br /><div>Finally I decided on a book I loved last year that just came out in paperback--<strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780316067638">Gods Behaving Badly</a></em></strong> by Marie Phillips. It tells the story of Greek gods run amok in modern London and the unsuspecting humans who fall prey to their shenanigans, and it completely charmed me when I first read it. Thinking about the book always makes me smile, and while part of me feels like maybe it's more of a summer read I decided in the end that maybe it's actually good to have something light and fun to turn to while cold brutal winter sets in over the next few weeks. </div>
