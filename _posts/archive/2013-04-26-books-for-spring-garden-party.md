Please sit and have a cup of tea. Jeeves is readying the crustless cucumber sandwiches now and the crumpets are fresh from the oven.<br /><br />So, what did you think of the latest Jodi Picoult? A bit macabre for my tastes? What do you suppose we should read for our upcoming fancy book club?<br /><br />Oh, you know I quite agree that we should get multiple copies of books at a low cost from the Used Book Cellar at Brookline Booksmith. Quite right. Here's what they have on their ever-so-popular Book Club Picks shelf currently:<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tfVCo7NxMu0/UXlQy7Zs8iI/AAAAAAAABPk/JdPfxkq2Xko/s1600/CYMERA_20130425_114552.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tfVCo7NxMu0/UXlQy7Zs8iI/AAAAAAAABPk/JdPfxkq2Xko/s320/CYMERA_20130425_114552.jpg" width="240" /></a><i>Major Pettigrew's Last Stand</i> by Helen Simonson. A beloved pick for&nbsp;book groups<br />&nbsp;missing Downton Abbey. A widower and retired major of the super-traditional British stripe strikes up a friendship with a Pakistani shopkeeper in his sleepy village. Their relationship sparks gossip as it develops into something more.<br /><br /><i>The Postmistress</i> by Sarah Blake. Set in coastal Franklin, Massachusetts in 1940, a lady has taken the postal duties of her town over while the men are at war. But on one fateful day she KEEPS A LETTER, reads it and DOESN'T DELIVER. But rest assured this book will deliver on drama, suspense and juicy historical details.<br /><br /><i>The Pickup</i> by Nadine Gordimer. A woman's car breaks down in South Africa and a young Arab mechanic comes to her rescue. Their ensuing relationship is weft through taught political and social intrigue in one of Gordimer's best.
