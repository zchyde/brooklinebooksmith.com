Well. I'm here to tell you that we recently&nbsp;acquired&nbsp;a book in the UBC that forewarns of the trouble wrought by fantasy novels and thematically similar role-playing games. Before you start reading <i>The Hobbit</i>, or taking home a volume of the below-mentioned <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> guidebooks we have in used, please be aware of the chaos wrought by the Dark Lord when you play and have fun with EVIL.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A_muNvb9sfs/UIAuwvK1LgI/AAAAAAAAA5I/W3WmxDF8EXI/s1600/satan.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A_muNvb9sfs/UIAuwvK1LgI/AAAAAAAAA5I/W3WmxDF8EXI/s200/satan.jpg" width="130" /></a></div>In <i>Satanism and Occult-Related Violence: What You Should Know </i>($6.50 used), authors Michael D. Langone, Ph.D. (Psychology) and Linda O. Blood, BFA (Fashion Design) warn of what can happen when teenagers get too worked up by fantasy worlds and role-playing games: "[...] players lose sight of the fact that it is only a game [and] report that the action in D&amp;D is often described so vividly that they can visualize it as if they were watching it actually happen. [evidence is cited] indicating that 'fantasy role-playing games have been a significant factor in at least 125 deaths,'" when gamers take the game too far and start thinking they can cast spells away from the tabletop. So be warned, kids. D&amp;D is no laughing matter.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hE0iZZ_yIt8/UIAuhCYSA8I/AAAAAAAAA5A/kkt0orihz2E/s1600/dmg.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hE0iZZ_yIt8/UIAuhCYSA8I/AAAAAAAAA5A/kkt0orihz2E/s200/dmg.jpg" width="152" /></a></div>And if you want to learn why yourself, a wise customer sold off his collection of game guides, so the UBC currently has the <i>Dungeonmaster's Guide</i> (Core Rulebook II, $15) and the <i>Forgotten Realms Campaign</i> book ($20). And I challenge you, reader, to come try and play a game with me and some booksellers. Things might be crazy but this is the only way to get to the bottom of this Satanic menace.&nbsp;Also you should probably read <i>The Hobbit</i>&nbsp;before the movie comes out. Just to know what to expect when the kids are all dressin' like dragons and ringwraiths and skippin' about in the streets.
