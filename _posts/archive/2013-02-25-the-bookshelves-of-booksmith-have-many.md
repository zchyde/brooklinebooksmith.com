Come on, make a beeline<br />for everyone's favorite, the hat-bearing feline.<br />For&nbsp;here are some things that I'm certain are true - <br />two things, and I call them Thing 1 and Thing 2:<br />Thing 1 is that reading is better than not,<br />so you're far better off the more books that you've got.<br />Thing 2's an addendum to good old&nbsp;Thing 1:<br />that reading is better whenever it's fun.<br />So come into Booksmith!
