<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.nataliedee.com/011611/noooo-aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 435px;" src="http://www.nataliedee.com/011611/noooo-aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh.jpg" border="0" alt="c/o nataliedee.com" /></a><br />(<a href="http://www.nataliedee.com/">pic c/o Natalie Dee</a>)<br /><br />Welp, I finished moving last blizzardy Tuesday morning. And there was an NStar truck blocking the top of my one-way street. But we forged on. Things are well, if a little tricky; I am staying calm in spite of a giant life change and computer science homework. Really, one of the hardest parts of this has been what to do with the books. See, I've moved from a sunny, spacious apartment and had to fit my belongings into a much, much, much tinier room. But the apartment's perks do include the happiest three-legged pit bull of all time (!) and a roofdeck and parks nearby. And in the midst of the crappy packing process and ensuing dust allergy flareup, I found the very first love letter someone ever wrote me. <br /><br />But I had to downsize. A lot. It's been so hard over the last 3 1/2 years  of working here to resist the temptation of new books and advance reader copies - and the lifetime of book hoarding before Booksmith. But now they will just not physically fit.<br /><br />So I decided I would keep my 50 most essential books. Okay. Maybe 100. I don't know. It was hard.<br /><br />How does one even decide? I guess it all came down to this: what would I never read again? What would I just never get around to anytime soon? What comforts me? What is wise and helpful? What do I find creatively inspiring? And I don't <em>really</em> need two copies of <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780199536368"><em>Crime and Punishment</em></a>, do I? <br /><br />(I was also hugely inspired by <em>Hoarders</em> which Kate made me watch and it made me fear for my future.)<br /><br />So I made a list a bit after I left my last place, when I was away from most of them, and just wrote the titles I just couldn't part with kind of instinctually based on that criteria. My Flannery O'Connor collection. My Mishimas. My Melvilles. Mary Gaitskill. <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780802143334">The Children's Hospital</a></em>. <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780486478036">Wuthering Heights</a></em>, obviously. <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780812971675">Absurdistan</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780061346187">The Will to Whatevs</a></em>, which I flip open when I need to laugh. The awesome works from awesome new guys, like  <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780982081389">Rachel Glaser</a> and <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780977934362">Mike Young</a> and the neat things from <a href="http://www.airforcejoyride.com/gg">Greying Ghost Press</a>. And the advance reader for Sarah Silverman's <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780061856433">The Bedwetter</a></em> where she inscribed it and called me "unprofessional."<br /><br />So last week, I sold back a bunch to <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/ubc">our used book cellar</a>. I made $81. That made it less painful, especially as I just parted with I don't know how much on textbooks. And Carl said someone had just been looking for <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781936041220">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a></em>, so I felt good about that at least, that someone will get the Oscar Wilde they need.<br /><br />Aaand I still have more to sell. Sigh. And the ones I knew the UBC couldn't take - brought them to the lovely people of <a href="http://www.aac.org/site/PageServer?pagename=boomerangs_donations">Boomerangs</a>. There you will now find like half of my clothing and a lousy painting I made of Donald Rumsfeld's disembodied head floating over snack food. Also a Sega Genesis. Sigh.<br /><br />Here's about half of what I have left, with some DIY floating bookshelves c/o <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Invisible-Book-Shelf/">Instructables </a>and the Booksmith dollar cart:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_31I5CF0nua0/TU7kA4qpFRI/AAAAAAAAAB0/-ZVt1-hfWw4/s1600/diybookshelves2.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_31I5CF0nua0/TU7kA4qpFRI/AAAAAAAAAB0/-ZVt1-hfWw4/s320/diybookshelves2.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5570640492966253842" /></a><br /><br /><br />Sigh.
