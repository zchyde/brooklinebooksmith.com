Time to zone out in front of the television, eat a lot of sugary ice cream and forget everything you learned last year.<br /><br />...OR IS IT?<br /><br />What if I told you that there was a way to 1) learn new things about math while 2) LAUGHING OUT LOUD. How? You might ask.<br /><br />Oh, I'll tell you how.<br /><br />By picking up this rare jewel of a used book recently acquired in our Used Book Cellar, <i>Math Jokes 4 Mathy Folks</i>.<br /><br />This slim lil volume comes complete with some of these old chestnuts:<br /><br />Without geometry, life would be pointless.<br /><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8X0p8yA5bD4/UcyQ96HBIHI/AAAAAAAABUA/m4bQ288UZJQ/s1600/IMAG0028.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8X0p8yA5bD4/UcyQ96HBIHI/AAAAAAAABUA/m4bQ288UZJQ/s320/IMAG0028.jpg" width="191" /></a><br />Q: What do you get when you divide the circumference of a jack-o-lantern by its diameter?<br />A: Pumpkin Pie.<br /><br />Q: What is a catenary?<br />A: A string held by a kitten at each end.<br /><br />...and SO MAN MORE. Run, don't walk.<br /><br />Also, if you like used books, reading in the summer and not walking down the stairs your friendly, helpful and eager used books staff have curated a brilliant collection of books perfect for summertime reading that are now in a handsome bookcase at the top of the stairs, next to the newspapers.
