<a href="https://images.indiebound.com/531/277/9780553277531.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://images.indiebound.com/531/277/9780553277531.jpg" width="194" /></a>At the beginning of every summer, when I'm most excited to go swimming and my bottle of waterproof sunblock is barely opened, I pick up&nbsp;<i>Dandelion Wine</i>&nbsp;by Ray Bradbury. I've had this mass market copy since high school, the spine remaining miraculously uncracked. It has suffered under a variety of writing implements: pink glitter pen, an Eberhard-Faber Mongol #2 pencil, a Pilot GPS-Fine, and the occasional off-black hotel pen. It has been carelessly thrown into over a decade of summer bags, been splashed by three oceans, and has held all sorts of bookmarks (receipts, pens, and most notably, even smaller books). It is loved.<br /><div><br />I've already finished <i>Dandelion Wine,</i>&nbsp;and am diving right into this summer's behemoth series:&nbsp;Anthony Powell's&nbsp;<i>A Dance to the Music of Time,</i>&nbsp;twelve complete books collected in four movements. It isn't very portable, with each volume reaching at least 700+ pages. I happened to snag two of the books in mass market editions, so I have bright orange Penguin paperbacks of&nbsp;<i>A Buyer's Market&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>At Lady Molly's&nbsp;</i>to give me a brief break from carrying around the beautiful (but giant) volumes from the complete set. <br /><br /></div><div>Most of the year I can't quite stand to hold mass markets. &nbsp;I prefer hardcovers and trade paperbacks, sturdy independent things that can be propped open and don't need to be precisely cradled in your hand to read. &nbsp;Yet, when summer rolls around? I don't mind mass markets. &nbsp;They're full of badges of honor--pages torn from that time you gave a tourist directions, pages marked with directions from when you were a tourist that needed directions, folded pages, pages flecked with sunblock, back cover warped from the time you put your iced tea on it for a bit too long, pages turning yellow with age.</div>
