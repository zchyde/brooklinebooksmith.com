"...they make billions" she said, as we shook our head over the greed of a certain monolithic octopus online corporation that is threatening to stop selling goods to my homestate's businesses, should the state pass a law that requires that corporation to collect sales tax on goods sold to businesses there. <br /><br />you know who doesn't make billions?<br />writers<br />clowns <br />comedians<br />99.9% of actors<br />poets<br />painters<br />sculptors<br />graffiti artists<br />chefs<br />dancers<br />singers<br />musicians<br />99.9% of filmmakers<br />teachers.<br /><br />And not one of them, not <em>one </em>of them, who over the course of my life have provided the spark for my laughter, or brought tears to my eyes, or lit a fire of inspiration inside of me, have ever threatened to withhold their services, for any reason. <br /><br />Buy poetry, as a friend wrote here recently.  <br />And look at paintings, and taste the food you eat, <br />and listen to the words of the songs you hear. <br /> <br />And don't let anyone tell you that a corporation is a person.
