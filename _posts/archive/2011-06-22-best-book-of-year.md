<div id="divSignature">Have you ever finished a great book, such as <em><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763638122">Drowned Maiden's Hair</a></em>, and think it's the best book you've read in a long while?&nbsp; And that you almost don't want to pick up a new book right away because no book will be as good? ...And then it happens.&nbsp; That next book completely blows the "great" book&nbsp;out of the water?</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I highly recommend Ruta Sepetys' <em><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780399254123">Between Shades of Gray</a>.</em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XT0tHsuLDys/TgJpvNjipRI/AAAAAAAAAQA/Br8nAu7BNxM/s1600/7824322.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; cssfloat: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" i$="true" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XT0tHsuLDys/TgJpvNjipRI/AAAAAAAAAQA/Br8nAu7BNxM/s320/7824322.jpg" width="212" /></a></div><div>So many World War 2 novels focus on prison camps&nbsp;pertaining to&nbsp;the Holocaust.&nbsp; But there was so much more happening at this time.&nbsp; Now comes the story of Lina, a young Lithuanian artist, and her family, trapped in the secret and horrific Russian genocide, 1939-1954.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the amazing plots turns or&nbsp;gripping page turners, but one of my favorite parts was the mother.&nbsp; Even when others around her became full of rage and trapped themselves in a world&nbsp;bitterness, she never stopped caring for them.&nbsp; She knew that survival meant helping and caring for each other -- no matter the cost.</div><div>I stayed up late to finish each section.&nbsp; </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>When done, I couldn't simply walk away.&nbsp; </div>
