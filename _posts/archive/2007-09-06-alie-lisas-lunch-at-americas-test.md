Alie and Lisa had lunch today at the <a href="http://www.americastestkitchen.com/">America's Test Kitchen </a>studios where they got a taste (literally!) of the new books being published this fall by the ATC folks, the ones behind <em>Cooks Illustrated</em> magazine and the <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780936184746"><strong><em>Best Recipe</em></strong> </a>cookbook series. Normally I would be very jealous, but they brought me back so many goodies that I am grinning like an idiot.<br /><br /><br />First was a slice of chocolate cake that did, indeed, take the cake. Alie told me there was a secret ingredient--sauerkraut! The recipe came from their new cookbook <strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781933615189">America's Best Lost Recipes</a></em></strong>, which I have been looking forward to since they began their <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9049243">Heirloom Recipe Reservation Project</a> through their <em>Cook's Country</em> magazine. (link takes you to a story about the project from NPR--with the Chocolate Sauerkraut Cake recipe!).<br /><br /><br />Alie told me they had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runza">runzas </a>for lunch (the recipe was a runner-up in the lost recipe contest), which she had never heard of before. I hadn't either until I became best friends with a girl from Nebraska. So I guess it's just as well that I wasn't at lunch--I'm sure the runza recipe in the cookbook is fine, but I'm also sure that it can't compare with my friend Kari's family recipe!<br /><br /><br />Alie also brought me a galley of a new book in the Best Recipe series--<a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781933615172"><strong><em>The Best International Recipe</em></strong></a>, coming out in November. This is one I didn't know about, and after looking at it I am super-psyched! It reminds me of Mark Bittman's <strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780767906722">The Best Recipes in the World</a></em></strong> but in <em>Cook's Illustrated</em> style--fewer recipes, but each is accompanied by a fantastic essay on its development, testing, and refinement. Though Bittman is usually my go-to-guy, I have to say the ATC folks take this round. Definitely check it out!
