Yipes! Dear lord, I've barely started reading fall titles.<br /><br />As a result, most of my suggestions were for picture books I saw when my reps visited. I nominated <em><a href="http://brooklinebooksmith.blogspot.com/2007/05/whats-new-cover-worth_07.html">The Apple Pie that Papa Baked</a></em>, <em><a href="http://brooklinebooksmith.blogspot.com/2007/06/candlewick-lights-up-my-life.html">The Magic Rabbit</a></em>, and <a href="http://brooklinebooksmith.blogspot.com/2007/07/vacation.html"><em>Book of 1,000 Days</em> </a>(the non-picture book exception).<br /><br />I also nominated a book that has just been released but I think actually has more of a fall vibe to it. Since it's already available, though, let me recommend it to you now--<br /><br /><strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9780060823276">Mucumber McGee and the Half-Eaten Hot Dog</a></em></strong><br />Written and Illustrated by Patrick Loehr<br /><br />Mucumber McGee has, in his desperate hunger, eaten a hot dog straight from the back of the fridge. His sister has warned him of eminent death. This is much worse than swallowing a watermelon seed! "Cheerful Gothic" may be a curious sounding description, but it perfectly fits this story-in-rhyme and its illustrations.
