My brother sings this part of the song whenever we talk about winning the lottery. Which we do...a lot. He actually is quite convincing...and even a little moving when he sings...but what <em>does</em> it mean to "biddy biddy bum"? </div><br /><div>            For me, Biddy-biddy bum means poetry, and reality television. Today, at the register I thought a lot about dress shopping, AND HOW AWFUL I AM AT IT. Sorry to yell but it's true!</div><div> </div><div> </div><div>          What do I need a dress for ?... (You may be asking yourself?) Well , I am going to sunny- warm Pennsylvania to attend my fella's sister's weddin. Yes, I did consider a pant-suit but I'm not quite ready to give in to the inevitable segregation of my generous thighs. </div><div> </div><div> </div><div>                The point is, when I go on vacation these days it always seems to be for some family party, holiday, event, trial. I look forward to the day when I can peruse our ever expanding magazine collection (that Dana is gardening into quite the  selection) and pick out a magazine like this one that the lovely Katie is holding, and read it....without a tinge of irony.</div><div> </div><div> </div><div>Well, It's getting to be about time for me to buy some spanx knock-off brand supportive undergarments and chap-stick so I can really do it up for this nuptial vacation.</div><div> </div><div>See you at the shelves!</div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 237px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 279px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5508341245115530130" border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/THGPLZC-e5I/AAAAAAAAAHw/W985mT_b9nA/s400/affluent.bmp" /></div>
