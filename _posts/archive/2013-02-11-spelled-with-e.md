My passion for all things <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> is well-documented. I've read the books ragged. I'm reliving them in audio form now. When a recent edition of some of the books made middle-grade kindred spirit&nbsp;Anne look like a YA heroine in need of a plot beyond a love interest (and also blond,&nbsp;rendering impossible&nbsp;the meet-cute in which Anne's own future&nbsp;love interest calls her "Carrots" and she breaks a slate on his head), I couldn't stop showing it to other booksellers, prefacing it with, "Wanna see something horrible?"<br /><br />So when I say I like <em>Emily of New Moon</em> at least as much as I like <em>Anne of Green Gables</em>, I don't say it lightly.<br /><br />Emily, the star of another series by <i>Anne</i>&nbsp;author (and my secret best friend, though she didn't live long enough to know it) L.M. Montgomery, is similar to Anne in a lot of ways. Both are orphans raised by well-meaning guardians who just need a little help in the imagination department, and both are exactly the right people to deliver that help.<br /><br />But pretty much everything Anne is, Emily is more so. Anne is imaginative and dabbles in writing; Emily writes obsessively and has a psychic incident once per otherwise-realistic book. Anne has a "bosom friend" in Diana; Emily has an impassioned friendship with Ilse, complete with raging quarrels. Anne has red hair and freckles; Emily has elf's ears, for cryin' out loud.<br /><br />Um, I'll be curled up in the corner rereading this if anyone needs me.
