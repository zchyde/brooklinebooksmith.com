Today I opened my email from <a href="https://www.randomhouse.com/crown/clarksonpotter.html">Clarkson Potter </a>(part of Random House, Clarkson Potter focuses on cooking) and saw a link to a little <a href="https://www.fodors.com/news/story_2952.html">interview with Ming Tsai </a>about some of his Boston favorites. </div><br /><div>In case you don't know <a href="https://www.ming.com/">Chef Tsai</a>, he owns <a href="https://www.ming.com/blueginger/">Blue Ginger</a>, an acclaimed restaurant (that I really hope to try when I have a reason to splurge) near our <a href="https://www.wellesleybooksmith.com/">sister store in Wellesley </a>and is the author of the cookbook <strong><em><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780609605301">Blue Ginger</a></em></strong>, a classic that has been on our shelves since it was first published in 1999!</div><br /><div>Note to self: Must head to Porter Exchange to try Sapporo Ramen. </div><div>Note to you: If you'd like to sign up for Clarkson Potter's Recipe Club newsletter you can subscribe by sending an email to <a href="mailto:sub_potter@info.randomhouse.com">sub_potter@info.randomhouse.com</a></div><br /><div></div>
