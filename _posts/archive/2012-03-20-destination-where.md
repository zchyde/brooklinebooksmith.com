We have been making some exciting changes, all to benefit our browsers. If you can't find your favorite section, we'll be happy to show you its new home.<br /><br />Destination Literature has found a new--well, destination--and is now integrated with our travel guides in aisle two. We'll be&nbsp;bringing our wall maps upstairs&nbsp;and keeping everything you need to plan your next trip in one place, so the only traveling you do is the travel you planned. Think of it as a one stop shop. <br /><br />So, if&nbsp;you're looking for a guide to Venice, you can find<a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781612380179"> <em>Rick Steve's Venice 2012</em></a> next to Joseph Brodsky's meditations on the city in his elegant travelogue&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780374523824">Watermark</a></em>.<br /><br />If you're traveling to Australia we have&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780307928443">Fodor's Australia</a></em> in full color sharing a shelf with Bill Bryson's classic&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780767903868">In a Sunburned Country</a></em> and&nbsp;Gail Jones' new novel <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781250003737">Five Bells</a></em>.<br /><br />Going to London?

Last weekend a customer traveling to Thailand to visit her grandchildren stopped by to&nbsp;pick up a Thai phrasebook. "I'm going to visit friends in Nebraska before Thailand," she told me, wondering what could prepare her for the open skies and home-baked culture of the Midwest. She left the store well prepared for&nbsp;foreign lands,&nbsp;with Lonely Planet's <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781740597340">Thai Phrasebook</a></em> and Willa Cather's <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780395755143">My Antonia</a></em> tucked under arm. Let us know your travel plans and we'll help you find the literature--both practical and imaginative--you need to prepare for your next trip. <br /><br />Happy Travels!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
