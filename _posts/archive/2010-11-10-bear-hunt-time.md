Watch this story. <br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/ytc0U2WAz4s?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/ytc0U2WAz4s?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />Familiar, eh?  (And he actually is this animated in person.) Michael Rosen and Helen Oxenbury's rendition <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780689853494"><span style="font-style: italic;">Going on a Bear Hunt</span></a> remains to be a staple on the bookshelves of children and toddlers.  So many kids have sung this song in daycares and scout troops.  But what I love about this retelling is Rosen's brilliant sounds and actions of "swishy, swashy" and "squelch, squerch."  Along with Oxenbury's illustrations, it is a captivating story that you can really get in to on the first read as well as the hundredth.<br /><br />Check out their most recent books:<br />Michael Rosen (and Kevin Waldron)'s <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763646813"><span style="font-style: italic;">Tiny Little Fly</span></a><br />Have you ever wanted to catch that pesky fly that lands on your ear and nose? So does the tramping elephant roaming around, the filthy rolling hippo, and the snatchful winking tiger.  Like <span style="font-style: italic;">Bear Hunt</span>, this book is great for younger children and the sounds and actions you could do with this picturebook might be just as great.<br /><br />Helen Oxenbury (and John Burningham)'s <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763649074"><span style="font-style: italic;">There's Going to be a Baby</span></a><br />This little boy is anticipating the arrival of a new sibling.  But what will he or she be like? If it's a boy then his name should be "Peter or Spider-Man."   If he grows up to be a chef, "I don't think I'd eat anything that was made by the baby."  The swirls of opinions and questions this boy has will coincide with listeners who have the same predicament.  Who is this new baby and what do I do with it?
