With these temperatures soaring and schools letting out for the summer, you can't deny it is summer.&nbsp; All of our summer reading books for the Brookline schools are up.&nbsp; We have them all seperated by grade and category for easy browsing and quick-pick-ups.<br /><br />Of course we have many other books to select from for the long summer ahead.&nbsp; If you are looking for an easy going middle grade series for a young girl, I highly recommend Ann Martin's<a href="http://www.scholastic.com/mainstreet/index.htm"> <em>Main Street series</em></a>.&nbsp; Flora, age 11, and Ruby, age 8, have recently moved&nbsp;to their&nbsp;grandmother's house in a fictional Massachussetts town by the name of Camden Falls.&nbsp; Throughout the series the girls learn to adjust to small town life, new friends, new school, new experiences, and life without their parents.&nbsp; Even though it is realistic fiction, heavy subject matter is kept&nbsp;very low key.&nbsp; Start the first book <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780439868792">here</a>!<br /><br />You don't necessarily need hard core subject matter books that make you think about humanity and other life changing inspirations and catastrophes for a good read.&nbsp; It's nice to have a break from all that once in a while -- especially on vacation.
