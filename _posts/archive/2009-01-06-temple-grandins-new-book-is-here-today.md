I need to get a move-on and finish <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780007149834"><em>The Yiddish Policemen's Union</em> </a>because I want to make sure to finish Ms. Grandin's book before next week when she'll be reading from it here at the Booksmith. That's right, TEMPLE GRANDIN WILL BE SPEAKING AT BROOKLINE BOOKSMITH A WEEK FROM TODAY--Tuesday, January 13th at 7:00! </div><br /><div>(Hmm, I seem to have caught caps lock fever from Christopher Moore) </div>
