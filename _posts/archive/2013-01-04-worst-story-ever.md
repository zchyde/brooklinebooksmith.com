After a whirlwind tour of NYC, in which I stopped in to the SoHo indie McNally Jackson and loaded up on crazy awesome books, I got stuck on a Chinatown bus in the blizzard with NO LIGHTS WITH WHICH TO READ. Couldn't use my phone because it was dying after hours stuck on the bus. Man. The Worst. But I made it home safely so count your blessings, right?<br /><br />But seriously, being stuck somewhere for hours with great, new books and no way to read them is really the worst thing I can think of (#firstworldproblems). But other people have it worse. Check out this worst-case-scenario roundup from our used book treasures:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><i>No Exit</i> by Sartre. For some, hell is other people. But being stuck in this room for eternity with the feeling of being unable to escape was a lot like being on that bus!<br /><br /><i>The Plague</i> by Camus. Bad enough you can't leave the Algerian town of Oran, worse still if the reason is because the bubonic plague has broken out.<br /><br /><i>Agamemnon </i>by Aeschylus. You go to war for 20 some-odd years and come home to find your wife M-A-D. Man, ain't that just the way.<br /><br /><i>Atonement </i>by Ian McEwan. Wow what if flirting with someone led to <i>this</i>&nbsp;series of unfortunate events? Harsh.<br /><br /><i>The Road</i> by Cormac McCarthy. It could be worse, though. There could always be nuclear winter followed by cannibals.<br /><br />Any holiday travel horror stories? Lay 'em on me. Can you think of WORSE books? Let's hear it in the comments! Thanks for reading folks!
