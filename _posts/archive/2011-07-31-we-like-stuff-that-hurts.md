On night 2 of heavy guilt-free forest-drinking around a fire, my brother asked me what compels me to read poetry, and I thought to myself (YOU! You asshole, bought me my first collection of Emily D. when I was 8) and, well I did say that out loud I had to follow it with something a bit more eloquent; and here is the ugliness that unfurled.</div><br /><br /><br /><br /><div>"Mike, I like to read poetry because you can get away with a lot of weird shit."<br /><br /></div><br /><div>"Like what?"</div><br /><br /><div>At this point I pulled out this poem I had written (a solid B minus at best) about eating dinner with a blind guy with blue prosthetic eyes, that always landed on my cleavage. I suspected their inauthenticity. My brother said and I quote:</div><br /><div></div><br /><div>"That is just messed up, why would anyone want to read about that? That's sick"</div><br /><div></div><br /><div>I chewed on that. Then I thought about a poem my pal Shawna had me read, and how it hurt to read, in the best "scratching an itch" kind of way:</div><br /><div></div><br /><div></div><br /><div></div><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 225px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 220px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5635599986793232914" border="0" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vlW3j98ECZY/TjWsVE0BuhI/AAAAAAAAATM/F-72d4_5NN0/s400/amy1.jpg" /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Half Hanged Mary</strong></div><br /><br /><br /><div><em>by Margaret Atwood </em></div><br /><br /><br /><div><br />7 p.m.<br /><br />Rumour was loose in the air,<br />hunting for some neck to land on.<br />I was milking the cow,<br />the barn door open to the sunset.<br /><br />I didn’t feel the aimed word hit<br />and go on in like a soft bullet.<br />I didn’t feel the smashed flesh<br />closing over it like water<br />over a thrown stone.<br /><br />I was hanged for living alone,<br />for having blue eyes and a sunburned skin,<br />tattered skirts, few buttons,<br />a weedy farm in my own name,<br />and a surefire cure for warts.<br /><br />Oh yes, and breasts,<br />and a sweet pear hidden in my body.<br />Whenever there’s talk of demons<br />these come in handy.<br /><br />8 p.m.<br /><br />The rope was an improvisation.<br />With time they’d have thought of axes.<br /><br />Up I go like a windfall in reverse,<br />a blackened apple stuck back onto the tree.<br /><br />Trussed hands, rag in my mouth,<br />a flag raised to salute the moon,<br /><br />old bone-faced goddess, old original,<br />who once took blood in return for food.<br /><br />The men of the town stalk homeward,<br />excited by their show of hate,<br />their own evil turned inside out like a glove,<br />and me wearing it.<br /><br />9 p.m.<br /><br />The bonnets come to stare,<br />the dark skirts also,<br />the upturned faces in between,<br />mouths closed so tight they’re lipless.<br />I can see down into their eyeholes<br />and nostrils. I can see their fear.<br /><br />You were my friend, you too,<br />I cured your baby, Mrs.,<br />and flushed yours out of you,<br />Non-wife, to save your life.<br /><br />Help me down? You don’t dare.<br />I might rub off on you,<br />like soot or gossip. Birds<br />of a feather burn together,<br />though as a rule ravens are singular.<br /><br />In a gathering like this one<br />the safe place is the background,<br />pretending you can’t dance,<br />the safe stance pointing a finger.<br /><br />I understand. You can’t spare<br />anything, a hand, a piece of bread, a shawl<br />against the cold,<br />a good word. Lord<br />knows there isn’t much<br />to go around. You need it all.<br /><br />10 p.m.<br /><br />Well God, now that I’m up here,<br />with maybe some time to kill,<br />away from the daily<br />fingerwork, legwork, work<br />at the hen level,<br />we can continue our quarrel,<br />the one about free will.<br /><br />Is it my choice that I’m dangling<br />like a turkey’s wattle from this<br />more than indifferent tree?<br />If Nature is Your alphabet,<br />what letter is this rope?<br /><br />Does my twisting body spell out Grace?<br />I hurt, therefore I am.<br />Faith, Charity, and Hope<br />are three dead angels<br />falling like meteors or<br />burning owls across<br />the profound blank sky of Your face.<br /><br />12 midnight<br /><br />My throat is taut against the rope<br />choking off words and air;<br />I’m reduced to knotted muscle.<br />Blood bulges in my skull,<br />my clenched teeth hold it in;<br />I bite down on despair.<br /><br />Death sits on my shoulder like a crow<br />waiting for my squeezed beet<br />of a heart to burst<br />so he can eat my eyes<br /><br />or like a judge<br />muttering about sluts and punishment<br />and licking his lips<br /><br />or like a dark angel<br />insidious in his glossy feathers<br />whispering to me to be easy<br />on myself. To breathe out finally.<br />Trust me, he says, caressing<br />me. Why suffer?<br /><br />A temptation, to sink down<br />onto these definitions.<br />To become a martyr in reverse,<br />or food, or trash.<br /><br />To give up my own words for myself,<br />my own refusals.<br />To give up knowing.<br />To give up pain.<br />To let go.<br /><br />2 a.m.<br /><br />Out of my mouths is coming, at some<br />distance from me, a thin gnawing sound<br />which you could confuse with prayer except that<br />praying is not constrained.<br /><br />Or is it, Lord?<br />Maybe it’s more like being strangled<br />than I once thought. Maybe it’s<br />a gasp for air, prayer.<br />Did those men at Pentecost<br />want flames to shoot out of their heads?<br />Did they ask to be tossed<br />on the ground, gabbling like holy poultry,<br />eyeballs bulging?<br /><br />As mine are, as mine are.<br />There is only one prayer; it is not<br />the knees in the clean nightgown<br />on the hooked rug.<br />I want this, I want that.<br />Oh far beyond.<br />Call it Please. Call it Mercy.<br />Call it Not yet, not yet,<br />as Heaven threatens to explode<br />inwards in fire and shredded flesh, and the angels caw.<br /><br />3 a.m.<br /><br />wind seethes in the leaves around<br />me the trees exude night<br />birds night birds yell inside<br />my ears like stabbed hearts my heart<br />stutters in my fluttering cloth<br />body I dangle with strength<br />going out of the wind seethes<br />in my body tattering<br />the words I clench<br />my fists hold No<br />talisman or silver disc my lungs<br />flail as if drowning I call<br />on you as witness I did<br />no crime I was born I have borne I<br />bear I will be born this is<br />a crime I will not<br />acknowledge leaves and wind<br />hold on to me<br />I will not give in<br /><br />6 a.m.<br /><br />Sun comes up, huge and blaring,<br />no longer a simile for God.<br />Wrong address. I’ve been out there.<br /><br />Time is relative, let me tell you<br />I have lived a millennium.<br /><br />I would like to say my hair turned white<br />overnight, but it didn’t.<br />Instead it was my heart;<br />bleached out like meat in water.<br /><br />Also, I’m about three inches taller.<br />This is what happens when you drift in space<br />listening to the gospel<br />of the red hot stars.<br />Pinpoints of infinity riddle my brain,<br />a revelation of deafness.<br /><br />At the end of my rope<br />I testify to silence.<br />Don’t say I’m not grateful.<br /><br />Most will only have one death.<br />I will have two.<br /><br />8 a.m.<br /><br />When they came to harvest my corpse<br />(open your mouth, close your eyes)<br />cut my body from the rope,<br />surprise, surprise,<br />I was still alive.<br /><br />Tough luck, folks,<br />I know the law:<br />you can’t execute me twice<br />for the same thing. How nice.<br /><br />I fell to the clover, breathed it in,<br />and bared my teeth at them<br />in a filthy grin.<br />You can imagine how that went over.<br /><br />Now I only need to look<br />out at them through my sky-blue eyes.<br />They see their own ill will<br />staring them in the forehead<br />and turn tail.<br /><br />Before, I was not a witch.<br />But now I am one.<br /><br />Later<br /><br />My body of skin waxes and wanes<br />around my true body,<br />a tender nimbus.<br />I skitter over the paths and fields,<br />mumbling to myself like crazy,<br />mouth full of juicy adjectives<br />and purple berries.<br />The townsfolk dive headfirst into the bushes<br />to get out of my way.<br /><br />My first death orbits my head,<br />an ambiguous nimbus,<br />medallion of my ordeal.<br />No one crosses that circle.<br /><br />Having been hanged for something<br />I never said,<br />I can now say anything I can say.<br /><br />Holiness gleams on my dirty fingers,<br />I eat flowers and dung,,<br />two forms of the same thing, I eat mice<br />and give thanks, blasphemies<br />gleam and burst in my wake<br />like lovely bubbles.<br />I speak in tongues,<br />my audience is owls.<br /><br />My audience is God,<br />because who the hell else could understand me?<br /><br />The words boil out of me,<br />coil after coil of sinuous possibility.<br />The cosmos unravels from my mouth,<br />all fullness, all vacancy. </div><br /><br /><br /><div></div><br /><br /><br /><div></div><br /><br /><br /><div></div>I love this poem. I'm reading <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780393072150">The Art of Cruelty</a> by Maggie Nelson, and I am becoming suspicious of why we are drawn to violence in art.<br /><br /><br /><div></div><br /><br /><div>I don't know.</div><br /><br /><br /><div></div><br /><div>I just know it feels like a greater violence to be coddled and comforted and lulled into a soup for my soul.</div><br /><br /><br /><div>I don't know.</div><br /><br /><div>I just know I like to read the ugly, it feels better.</div><br /><br /><div>Creepy. Isn't real beauty kinda ugly? There has to be something scary and vulgar to make it lovable, right?</div><br /><div></div><br /><br /><div>Thoughts on literary masochisms?</div>
