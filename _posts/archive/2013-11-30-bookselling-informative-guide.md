In a few hours, some of the sweetest authors I know are going to be giving up their Saturday to be guest booksellers for Small Business Saturday and the Indies First movement, hanging out at InfoSmith while doling out recommendations. Kristopher Jansma (<i>The Unchangeable Spots of Leopards</i>) and Morris Collins (<i>Horse Latitudes</i>) will be here from 12-2pm, and Jessica Keener (<i>Women in Bed</i>) and Maryanne O'Hara (<i>Cascade</i>) will be here from 2-4pm. &nbsp;They're excited to work at a bookstore on one of the busiest Saturdays of the year, and I salute them. <br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JNHQIfyFQ6I/Upn7m9vfqGI/AAAAAAAACgU/fJv33rP8pL8/s1600/indiesFirst.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="227" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JNHQIfyFQ6I/Upn7m9vfqGI/AAAAAAAACgU/fJv33rP8pL8/s320/indiesFirst.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />LIST OF FUN BOOKSMITH FACTS FOR OUR GUEST AUTHORS AS THEY HANG OUT AT INFOSMITH<br />1. We do not have a public restroom.<br />2. Search engines are beautiful, and Google is your friend.<br />3. We like wordplay and ridiculous jokes. &nbsp;Just sayin'.<br />4. Kismet is alive and well, and you'll find yourself in the middle of a busy aisle gushing over the same book with a customer. You'll feel like you've found your reading soul mate. <br />5. The calendars are right behind you.<br />6. Still don't have a public restroom.<br />7. The line at the register may seem long, but we typically get you in and out of there in less than 10 minutes.<br />8. Gift wrapping is downstairs, and yes, it is free.<br />9. People read everything and are looking for all sorts of things. &nbsp;This is the best part of the job, and you end up learning the most random things.<br />10. Busy days are the most fun, and you will definitely need to sit down once this is all over!<br /><br />Stop by our store, chat with our authors, and thank you for shopping with us on Small Business Saturday. &nbsp;From all of us, booksellers, giftsellers, and guest authors included--thank you for keeping us here.
