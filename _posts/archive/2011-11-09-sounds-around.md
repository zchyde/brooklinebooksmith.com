<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EjzwiQfHGlg/TrsYftKBDMI/AAAAAAAAAR4/psbWOvREJYY/s1600/RedSled.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EjzwiQfHGlg/TrsYftKBDMI/AAAAAAAAAR4/psbWOvREJYY/s200/RedSled.jpg" width="190" /></a>Every year I am always on the look out for the new the&nbsp;fantastic winter holiday season picturebook. Looking through some of them in the summer (yes, we see them that early for ordering purposes) I wonder&nbsp;if any will catch my eye.&nbsp; And then one finally&nbsp;does.&nbsp; When it arrives in our store approximately four months later, we are nearly inseparable.&nbsp; This year it is Lita Judge's <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781442420076">Red Sled</a></em>.&nbsp; Let's sled along to the form of this new release...</div><br />What do you think of when you hear the words "wordless picturebook"?&nbsp; For me, the last words on my mind are "babyish."&nbsp; Sadly, this is what some customers view them as.&nbsp; However, the amount of words have nothing to do with the appeal, age level,&nbsp;or success of a book.&nbsp; For picturebooks, it is not simply the words that drive a story but the art.<br /><br />I love wordless picturebooks for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; The first is that it gives children an opportunity to read the story to you, even if they can't read yet.&nbsp; The second is that it teaches art skills. How do you know the character is intrigued if there are no words to indicate this?&nbsp; Through the illustrations.&nbsp; When I nannied for two small children one summer, the three-year-old asked me what the character liked to do for fun.&nbsp; We had a great time looking at the illustrations discovering various things that this character enjoyed doing and looking at&nbsp;the toys she had.<br /><br />All right, so back to <em>Red Sled</em>. &nbsp;A boy's sled is borrowed by a bear who ventures out&nbsp;with it.&nbsp; Soon a rabbit joins him.&nbsp; And then a moose, two&nbsp;raccoons, a mouse, a&nbsp;possum, and a porcupine.&nbsp; What a great midnight adventure!&nbsp; Guess who joins the next night? <br /><br />As you may have guessed this book is a wordless picturebook -- with the exception of some onomatopoeia.&nbsp; The sounds really work to bring the story to a whole new dimension.&nbsp; I mean, when your sledding, shouts of joy are often inevitable.&nbsp; And then&nbsp;there are screams of fear.&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge depicts&nbsp;the huge difference between this:<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-is4SwB829NE/TrsYH3KYQZI/AAAAAAAAARo/nJQej0Pl1MU/s1600/_ill_whoa1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="98" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-is4SwB829NE/TrsYH3KYQZI/AAAAAAAAARo/nJQej0Pl1MU/s200/_ill_whoa1.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">AND this:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AN2Qny9-dPU/TrsYOEOmgBI/AAAAAAAAARw/Fapy9OKgYyE/s1600/_ill_whoa3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="101" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AN2Qny9-dPU/TrsYOEOmgBI/AAAAAAAAARw/Fapy9OKgYyE/s200/_ill_whoa3.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><br /><br />The art of the picturebook is illustration.  Words exist to help drive the story along and to add to the atmosphere of the story.&nbsp; And sometimes sounds take it that much further.
