By the time you read this, I will be on my way to Quebec for a week, and will probably be engrossed in <em>Rose Under Fire</em>, the upcoming companion novel to <em>Code Name Verity. </em>(Wait, Rose suffers some fairly major flight mishaps, doesn't she? Maybe I should rethink this packing choice.)<br /><br />The very capable Amy and Clarissa will be holding down the fort (that's what we need in the kids' section! A fort!). Both are savvy, both know their stuff, and both are a lot of fun to talk to about kids' and YA books, because both are wildly enthusiastic. So keep the questions coming, folks. (But maybe go easy on pulling books out of the spinner. They've got a lot of work on their hands.)<br /><br />See you next week!
