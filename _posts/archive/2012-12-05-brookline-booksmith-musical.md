<br /><div class="MsoNormal">Lately, I’ve been noticing a theme around e-mail signoffs.&nbsp; The stereotypical “best” has been replaced by a cheery hope that I “stay sane through the holidays.”&nbsp; This support warms my heart, and also brings me to an idea that has been brewing in my head for a while:&nbsp;<i>Brookline Booksmith: The Musical.</i></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">Now, before Dana, our beautiful and delightful store manager questions me about this “creative” idea, hear me out.&nbsp; </div><br />REASONS WHY <i>BROOKLINE BOOKSMITH: THE MUSICAL </i>IS KIND OF A GOOD IDEA<br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal">1. A few days ago, I saw one of my fellow booksellers dancing away from the register, full body movement and all.&nbsp; It could have been interpreted as an enthusiastic walk, but… no.&nbsp; I know what dancing looks like, and that was dancing.&nbsp; </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">2. Booksellers sing, sometimes in the back, sometimes not.&nbsp; Yesterday, another bookseller and I did a lovely duet of Alphaville’s “Forever Young” while clearing the hold shelf.&nbsp; I choose to believe it was a delight to hear, and I will not accept evidence to the contrary. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">3. The wooden floors upstairs are great for practicing amateur tap dancing.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">4. When <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781451621372" target="_blank">Susannah Cahalan</a> was here, I made brief mention of <i>Brookline Booksmith: The Musical</i>.&nbsp; She enthusiastically supported the idea (okay, okay, she said she thought it was cool), leading me to believe we could have a rotating lineup of author guest stars.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">What does this have to do with anything?&nbsp; Besides potentially being one of the greatest and most poorly sung musicals of all time, this kind of thing keeps us sane.&nbsp; <i>Brookline Booksmith: The Musical</i> will remain in my head, but we’ll keep singing and dancing our way through the holidays with our sanity fully intact.</div>
