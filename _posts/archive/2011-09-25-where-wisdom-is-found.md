<br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>Thus commencing weekly tales from the depths of the Booksmith: the Used Book Cellar.</em></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Last week, your faithful used book buyers acquired several titles (as per usual), but the following particularly peculiar finds illustrate the many forms in which wisdom passes our desk.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oYvG620_stk/Tn9tt1rZrNI/AAAAAAAAAH8/VSZS-znTP8c/s1600/dancing_with_dragons.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; cssfloat: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" hca="true" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oYvG620_stk/Tn9tt1rZrNI/AAAAAAAAAH8/VSZS-znTP8c/s1600/dancing_with_dragons.jpg" /></a></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><i>Dancing with Dragons; Invoke their Ageless Wisdom and Power</i> - for devotees of House Targaryen, or simply those with fire in their&nbsp;bellies, I present to you D. J. Conway's TIMELESS, CLASSIC work of dragon-wisdom. Available now for $8 is a singular volume containing all kinds of stories, rituals and tips on harnessing the dragon energy within you. But that's enough from me, allow the jacket copy to speak for itself: "Call on dragons to brighten your day-to-day life and to solve problems that require timeless wisdom." A great gift for the dragon fanatic in your life, or a charming addition to the library of any academic acquiring the vast wisdom of our realm.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rqQHF4Sdqdk/Tn9tzSZ0_wI/AAAAAAAAAIA/DiGy7RxCIh8/s1600/tenapples.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; cssfloat: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" hca="true" height="200" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rqQHF4Sdqdk/Tn9tzSZ0_wI/AAAAAAAAAIA/DiGy7RxCIh8/s200/tenapples.jpg" width="144" /></a></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">On to Exhibit 2, a young customer (with the assistance of her mother) has outgrown her Dr. Seuss collection and we have benefited. An entire library of Seuss: <i>Cat in the Hat</i>, <i>Green Eggs and Ham</i>, even the rarer <i>I Wish That I Had Duck Feet</i> can all be found in the UBC now, in great condition, priced at $5 each. The first stop of wisdom for most beings of this world, Dr. Seuss can never be underestimated. <i>Ten Apples Up On Top</i>, a CLASSIC, EPIC tale of perseverance and life-balance should never be forgotten. When any of us feels we have too many apples on top, and that "Our apples all/are going to drop," it serves well to remember that with the help of friends we can have "Ten apples/on us all!/What fun!/We will not/let them fall."</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7Q1HaOJGJvk/Tn9t3vCiCoI/AAAAAAAAAIE/YT9qXhNvlEk/s1600/Our_Oriental_Heritage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; cssfloat: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" hca="true" height="200" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7Q1HaOJGJvk/Tn9t3vCiCoI/AAAAAAAAAIE/YT9qXhNvlEk/s200/Our_Oriental_Heritage.jpg" width="132" /></a></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Finally, the UBC has also recently acquired 11 volumes of Will Durant's EPIC, EXHAUSTIVE <i>Story of Civilization</i>, a series of thousand-page (each!) tomes that cover the gamut of world history and culture in stunning hardcovers complete with bold dust jackets. Each volume is priced at $10.50. For all the wisdom contained herein, that's quite the bargain. Randomly opening to page 414 in Volume 1 ('Our Oriental Heritage,') Durant offers a valuable insight on the distinction between the foundations of Hinduism and Christianity: "It is an abstruse heaven, however, that Yajnavalkya [of <i>The Upanishads</i><span style="font-style: normal;">] promises</span> the devotee, for in it there will be no individual consciousness, there will only be absorption into Being, the reunion of the temporarily separated part with the whole. [...] Such a theory of life and death will not please Western man, whose religion is permeated with individualism as are his political and economic institutions."</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">No matter your age or interest, the UBC can satisfy the endless quest for wisdom, and on a budget, too. And if you need to make room for all this wisdom in your collection, we buy used books Wednesday through Saturday, 10 A.M. - 4 P.M.
