<span style="font-size: small;">Social media is a hot topic around the store these days, so I thought I'd blatantly steal a format I've seen succeed all over Facebook. Is there anything you'd like to see on our social media? Let us know! Now, on to important matters....</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br />Which setting sounds most appealing?</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">A. a snowy mountain</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">B. the popular kids' table</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">C. an American city whose neighborhoods have their own personalities</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">D. a European city full of art and tortured artists</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: small;">Something is bothering you. What do you do?</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">A. run and hide until you just have to let your feelings out</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">B. write about it in your diary</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">C. confront it. Bravery is your defining quality! Your only one! Really!</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">D. get as much as you can out of today anyway</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;What do you like to do with your friends?</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">A. build a snowman</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">B. talk about your crushes</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">C. jump off moving trains</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">D. track down your favorite authors</span><span style="font-size: small;"></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: small;">Where are you most likely to be found on a Saturday night?</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">A. Frost Ice Bar. The cold never bothered you anyway.</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">B. at a party... and then home telling your diary what a disaster it was</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">C. showing off your bravery and hiding your other traits</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">D. </span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: small;">rereading your favorite book and agonizing over its ending&nbsp;</span></span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Mostly A's: Your life is like <i>Frozen: The Big Golden Book</i>. Congratulations on being yourself, even if it means dancing in the snow in July!&nbsp;</span></span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Mostly B's: Your life is like the Dork Diaries books. Congratulations on being yourself, even if it means you're a dork!</span></span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Mostly C's: Your life is like <i>Divergent</i>: Congratulations on being yourself, even if you have to be dauntless to do so!</span></span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Mostly D's: Your life is like <i>The Fault in Our Stars</i> (purely in terms of personality, I hope). Congratulations on being loveable enough to make an entire generation cry.&nbsp;</span> </span></span>
