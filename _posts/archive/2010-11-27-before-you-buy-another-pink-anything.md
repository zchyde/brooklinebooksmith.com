<div><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TPF3AOZn5rI/AAAAAAAAAKw/yzpUE7mEAxo/s1600/cinderella.jpg"><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 251px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 381px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5544343462019065522" border="0" alt="" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TPF3AOZn5rI/AAAAAAAAAKw/yzpUE7mEAxo/s400/cinderella.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><div>I'm reading <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780061711527"><strong>Cinderella Ate My Daughter</strong> </a>by Peggy Orenstein, and I am absolutely enamored. The books isn't going to be released until Jan 25th....but it should be on your radar...</div><br /><br /><br /><br /><div></div><br /><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 268px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 254px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5544344449674370018" border="0" alt="" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TPF35ts_2-I/AAAAAAAAALA/zHikHS23ee4/s400/devine1.bmp" /><br /><br />The book takes an interesting survey of the landscape of girlhood. This book is helping me understand why I feel so sad when I walk past the clothing stores that target pre-teens, and I feel even sadder when I think about how children younger and younger are being targeted in board rooms across the land as a burgeoning demographic of pre-consumers.......(consumers). </div><div></div><div>tangent:<br /><br /><div>I knew I felt skittish about the Little Mermaid...I mean...this is a lady- fish who gives up her voice to be with a dude....or if you <em>really </em>wanna look at it, this is a chick who lost her voice when her legs split. Kinda haunting....(not to mention all the violence directed at Divine....I mean...Ursula)</div><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 333px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 240px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5544343964853313570" border="0" alt="" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TPF3dfmpoCI/AAAAAAAAAK4/qpuUW10crjE/s400/devine.jpg" /><br />All these topic are deftly adressed by Orenstein. I must run home to finish it before I wax on....<br /><br /><div>This author (Peggy-Orenstein) is coming to the store too! I'm sure I'll be writing more when the time comes closer to hosting this exciting, important and necessary read.</div><br /><br /><div>In the mean time, I'm buying my niece a copy of <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780920236161"><strong>The Paper Bag Princess</strong></a>, one of my favorite picture books about a little girl whose worth lies beyond her appearance. This little chicky has agency, and lacks vanity. She also rescues a fella in need. In-deed! Ex-hale!</div><br /><br /><div><strong></strong></div><br /><br /><div></div><br /><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 348px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 320px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5544345962386189314" border="0" alt="" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TPF5Rw_mbAI/AAAAAAAAALI/NRO7mh7j71Y/s400/paperbag.jpg" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div></div></div>
