Despite the deceptive weather out there (with such a warm autumn and no snow in sight...it's almost December, really?) the time has come to watch <i>Muppet Christmas Carol, Muppet Family Christmas, Prancer, How the Grinch Stole Christmas</i>, and a few other holiday classics over and over.&nbsp; Yahoo!<br /><br />Trivia...What is Christmas really?<br />-Pagan holiday originated from Rome<br />-Day Christians celebrate the birth of Christ<br />-Celebrations and festivities to brighten the darkness of winter<br />-Santa Claus and the act of giving gifts<br />-Decoration of Evergreens and other trees<br /><br />Actually, according to the History Channel's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5T5ibb2E9I&amp;feature=related"><i>Christmas unWrapped</i></a>, it is all of them!&nbsp; (You really should watch this documentary.&nbsp; It's such an eye opener.) Here is part 1 out of 5:<br /><object height="385" width="480"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/A5T5ibb2E9I?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/A5T5ibb2E9I?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />I think people get so isolated in their own traditions that they forget what all is out there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Personal traditions and beliefs are important, but what kind of life are you living when you are ignorant of other cultures? If you are atheist, don't be afraid to pick up a great picturebook on the birth of Christ.&nbsp; If you are Christian, don't be afraid to read your kids a book on Hanukkah (children's bookseller, Shoshana, highlighted a few titles earlier this week).&nbsp; Why not read a book on Santa, even if he doesn't visit your house? '<i>Twas the Night Before Christmas</i> is a great poem in and of itself.&nbsp; Ultimately, knowing about other religions and viewpoints on life will strengthen your own.&nbsp; A life lived in a box is no life at all.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you don't know where to start, come on in to the children's section.&nbsp; Our shelves are overflowing with fabulous wintery holiday books.&nbsp; Over the next three weeks I will share with you my favorite snow/winter books, Santa and fun christmas books, as well as great nativity stories. <br /><br />Happy Thanksgiving and wonderful festivities that come your way.
