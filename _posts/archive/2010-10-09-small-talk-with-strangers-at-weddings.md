We will sit at a table full of people I do not know, with god willing an open bar and decent albeit olive oil rich wedding grub. What to talk about? What to say? In these situations you have one of two choices.....talk about what you are reading, talk about what you are watching. Here is my practice run.</div><br /><div></div><br /><div>Hi! My name is Kate... Did you watch this week's <em>Biggest Loser</em>?</div><div> I did! It made my Sicilian pizza taste so much better to watch those good people working so hard.<br /><br /></div><div></div><div><br /></div><div>What's that? </div><div> </div><div>You don't own a TV? </div><div>(this is where I add up the steps to the bar with a near <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">rodentine</span> ferocity)</div><div> </div><div>...<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">ahhh</span> well then....Have you read anything good lately? Me? Well I'm really into the Room <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316098335">http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316098335</a>... yea...I'm also very into the poetry of Cate Marvin <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781889330617">http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781889330617</a> </div><div> </div><div>Oh! You're going to show me pictures of your great <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">nieces</span>? Wonderful.</div><div>Sure I can cut your beef for you mam.</div><div> </div><div>Yes I agree, when dancing one should always leave room for the holy spirit.</div><div>Yes I'd love a picture of the two of us...sure I'll meet your grandson; he sounds enchanting? I do love a man in head gear.</div><div> </div><div>This will go well. I can feel it.</div><div>I suppose it is good for me to get out. </div><div> </div><div><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 163px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 244px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5526090474330265506" border="0" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TLCeAgcgF6I/AAAAAAAAAI4/UsOpqA7mV2M/s400/11.jpg" /></div>
