In Sunday's NYTimes Book Review Jim Holt <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/books/review/Holt-t.html">writes about his endeavors in memorizing poetry</a>, which led me to think about the poems I know by heart.<br /><br />Two are fairly standard: William Carlos Williams's "<a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15535">This Is Just to Say</a>" and Robert Frost's "<a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/20519">Stopping By Woods On a Snowy Evening</a>."**<br /><br />Then there are Robert Herrick's poems. Have you read <a href="http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/197">Robert Herrick</a>? Probably not, or if you have it's his carpe diem classic "<a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15923">To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time</a>" which you know as "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may..." It's ok, but honestly, doesn't do much for me--what I really love is his, um, more, um, randy stuff. The stuff to Julia (and her legs, and breasts, and <a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/20307">clothes</a>--especially love the ones about <a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/19791">clothes</a>!). The stuff to Sylvia and <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=176772">Anthea </a>and Electra...ah, Electra.<br /><br />So, here it is, the poem I know by heart (I think I might be revealing a bit too much about myself with this one, but hey, what else are blogs written for anonymous readers for?):<br /><div align="center"></div><br /><div align="center">"The Vision to Electra" by Robert Herrick<br /></div><div align="center">I dreamed we both were in a bed</div><div align="center">Of roses, almost smothered.</div><div align="center">The warmth and sweetness had me there</div><div align="center">Made lovingly familiar;</div><div align="center">But that I heard thy sweet breath say,</div><div align="center">Faults done by night will blush by day;</div><div align="center">I kissed thee, panting, and I call</div><div align="center">Night to the record! that was all.</div><div align="center">But, ah! if empty dreams so please,</div><div align="center">Love, give me more such nights as these. </div><br /><div align="center"></div><br /><div align="left">Alrighty then! And if you liked that, check out "<a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=181082">The Vine</a>." It makes me giggle and blush in equal measure (which is what I love about Herrick--a fine combination of the erotic and the ridiculous). Herrick never married and claimed he was chaste, but I always have this image of him chasing his maid <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=181045">Prue</a> around the butcher block a time or two. </div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><br /><br />What poems do you know by heart? Who are your favorite poets? I'd love to hear.</div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><br /><br />** As I was just talking about <a href="http://brooklinebooksmith.blogspot.com/2009/03/dickensian-moment.html">Matthew MacFadyen</a> (if you are not watching <em>Little Dorrit, </em>do it now! You can watch <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/littledorrit/watch.html#">online</a>!), and could talk about him a bit more, here's his reading of "This is just to say": </div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/0d5bLf0gq2Q&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/0d5bLf0gq2Q&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>
