We buy hundreds of books on our buying days and hundreds of books are sold a week. Sometimes, out of these hundreds of books purchased and hundreds of books sold, some books don't find their forever home within a certain period of time. In order to make room for new acquisitions, we have to let these little guys loose for a SINGLE dollar so that they'll for sure be adopted. Many Brookline-ites know our dollar cart outside and our dollar bookcase inside well, many amazing bargains can be found upon their trusty shelves. Just this week I placed upon the cart the following books: <i>The Languages of Tolkein's Middle Earth, Death House Letters </i>of the Rosenbergs, a novel entitled <i>Fan Tan</i>&nbsp;written by MARLON BRANDO, an introductory guide to astral travel (didn't know you needed that, did you?) and a history of Werewolves in western culture.<br /><br />Basically really cool stuff that maybe didn't get snatched up because nobody thinks to look in writing books for the best possible guide on Elvish known to man. So come peruse our dollar carts and find a crazy bargain and awesome book. You can't go wrong for a $1 (you can't even buy a cup of coffee for that, and we're talking hours at least and years at most of entertainment!) OR, even if you're not a big reader, for like, $20 you can fill a bookshelf and impress house guests. Or you can buy a book so cheap to take on vacation that you won't have to worry about losing it. Stop on in!
