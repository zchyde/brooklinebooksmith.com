Each person here is ridiculously, ridiculously good at something. We each have our own speciality, possessing an encyclopedic knowledge about nearly every topic or format in the store including but not limited to: small press releases, penguins, math, Finnish authors, travel, dramatic YA books, elephants, French flaps. &nbsp;Because of this knowledge, we can make some really, <i>really</i>&nbsp;good recommendations.<br /><br />This is really all an excuse for me to tell you about my specialty, which is events. &nbsp;Straight-up events. &nbsp;If you're interested in something, anything! I can conjure up an event you might like.<br /><br /><i>Do you work during the weekday and wish you could go to a weekend story time with your kids?&nbsp;</i><br />On Saturday, January 19th at 10:30, the vocally brilliant and vibrant Tess will be hosting our monthly <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/storytime-jan2013" target="_blank">children's story time</a> right underneath the tree in our kids section. &nbsp;If you want more stories (who doesn't want more stories?), come back on Sunday, January 20th at 2pm when local publisher Pinwheel Books brings by a few of their picture book authors for their <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/event/pinwheel-books-2nd-annual-story-showcase" target="_blank">2nd annual story showcase</a>.<br /><br /><i>Do you wish you could go t<span style="font-family: inherit;">o a <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/event/ian-svenonius-supernatural-strategies" target="_blank">Saturday night&nbsp;</a></span></i><em style="background-color: white; line-height: 14.545454025268555px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/event/ian-svenonius-supernatural-strategies" target="_blank">s√©ance held by Ian Svenonius while a DJ is playing</a>?</span></em><br /><span style="line-height: 14.533333778381348px;">Yes.&nbsp;</span><br /><i style="line-height: 14.533333778381348px;">Follow-up question, are you free January 26?</i><br /><span style="line-height: 14.533333778381348px;">Your answer has to be yes, otherwise I'm going to have to do the Charlie Brown walk across Coolidge Corner traffic. &nbsp;Please say yes.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><i>Do you like books, history, and alcohol, in addition to being old enough to legally enter a bar?</i><br />We're having a Prohibition-themed party the night of January 20th at the Regal Beagle for <a href="https://www.ticketfly.com/event/200935" target="_blank">Stephanie Schorow's book, <i>Drinking Boston</i></a>. &nbsp;For a $35 ticket, you'll get a signed copy of the book, hors d'oeuvres, and two complimentary beverages. &nbsp;It's in conjunction with Union Park Press and Bully Boy Distillery, so you know it'll be a good time.<br /><br /><i>Are you a teen who likes John Green?</i><br />No, he's not coming to sign books (YET. &nbsp;It's one of my life missions to get him to read here, which would be an interesting sight due to my slightly feverish fangirl crush on him which would probably lead to an episode involving hyperventilating, no biggie, I'M COOL). &nbsp;I am, however, starting a <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/event/young-adult-book-club-jan-2013" target="_blank">Young Adult Book Club</a> for teens ages 12-18. &nbsp;Instead of choosing just one book, we're going to talk about any of John Green's works. &nbsp;Love <i>Looking for Alaska</i>? &nbsp;Did you cry at <i>The Fault in Our Stars?</i>&nbsp;Come by, we'll talk about our favorite John Green books and choose what we'll read for next month. This starts Monday, January 14 at 5pm.<br /><br />I could go on for hours about <a href="https://brooklinebooksmith.com/googlecalendar" target="_blank">upcoming events</a>, but I'll pause here. &nbsp;We have so many great authors coming in this month, so take a look at our calendar or ask me for a recommendation in the comments field. <br /><br />
