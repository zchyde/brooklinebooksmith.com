The most common question coming out of children's mouths is "why?"&nbsp; And, it's a logical question.&nbsp; If no one ever asked <em>why</em>, we really wouldn't know very much.&nbsp; <em>Why</em> is a question I often wonder if not enough adults ask, especially when it comes to what's in the food we eat.&nbsp; It's important to know what fuels our energy and brains.&nbsp; So, I love it when books incorporate how food makes it to our tables -- before cargo-loads, boxes, and plastic&nbsp;get&nbsp;involved.&nbsp; <br /><br /><em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763650056">How Did that Get in my Lunchbox? The Story of Food</a></em> (ages 4-12), by Chris Butterworth,&nbsp;is a wonderful non-fiction book for young readers that emphasizes food does not grow in stores, contrary to what some urban school children perceive.&nbsp; Butterworth takes you through the process of how bread is mixed, where apples are picked, how cheese is made, and so much more!&nbsp; There are undertones of appreciation for food and the people who produce it, as well as what kinds of foods are better for you.&nbsp; The most common comment customers give this award winning book is "beautiful" and "informative" and "exquisite."<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-r6adJ9rswNg/T5iTLxg3o1I/AAAAAAAAAW4/HJ-oTeTNC2E/s1600/51ZUMsk2kTL__SL500_AA300_.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" oda="true" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-r6adJ9rswNg/T5iTLxg3o1I/AAAAAAAAAW4/HJ-oTeTNC2E/s320/51ZUMsk2kTL__SL500_AA300_.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>Now, on to a new release: <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781419701771"><em>Minette's Feast: The Delicious Story of Julia Child and Her Cat</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>(ages 3-8), by Susanna Reich, beautifully illustrated and completely cat!&nbsp; Before Minette comes along, it is clear that Julia's life revolves around food.&nbsp; But no matter what amazing meals and smells are cooking up around Julia's&nbsp;apartment, this cat only prefers mice and birds.&nbsp; So, what does this book have to do with where food comes from?&nbsp; I mean, yes, Julia Child was a brilliant chef, but her food came from the markets.&nbsp; But Minette?&nbsp; She hunted.&nbsp; And that's how food is often acquired.&nbsp; Gruesome? To many, yes.&nbsp; But it is a fact of life just as hunting -- and foraging for berries and honey&nbsp;--&nbsp;is in Laura Ingalls Wilder's <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780064400404">Little House</a></em> series (ages 6-12), Elizabeth George Speare's <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780440479000">The Sign of the Beaver</a></em> (ages 8-12) and Gary Paulsen's <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781416936473">Hatchet</a></em>&nbsp;(ages 10-14).&nbsp; For one to live, something else must die.<br /><br />I don't know if it's because we are situated in New England or what, but there are quite a few books that illustrate&nbsp;what goes into&nbsp;pancakes and how&nbsp;maple syrup is extracted from trees.&nbsp; Tomie DePoala's <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780156707688">Pancakes for Breakfast</a></em> (ages 3-7) and Tyler Florence's <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062047526">Tyler Makes Pancakes</a></em> (ages 4-7) both take a journey to get the eggs from the hen, the milk and butter from cows, and the maple syrup from the maple farm.&nbsp; All is mixed and fried up, delivering smiles all around.&nbsp; (Kate Messner's <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780802723307">Sugar and Ice</a></em> is a great read for older readers --&nbsp;10-14&nbsp;-- that partially takes place on a running&nbsp;maple syrup farm.)<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Knowing what goes into your food and all of the work that it&nbsp;went through makes you appreciate it so much more!</span>
