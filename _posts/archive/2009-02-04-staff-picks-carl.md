Carl is one of our used-book sellers (He's a bookseller who works in the Used Book <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Cellar</span>. I love that way more than I should.). He also <a href="http://www.airforcejoyride.com/gg">publishes poetry</a> and writes an occasional blog about the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">UBC</span> that you can read <a href="http://usedbooksmith.blogspot.com/">here </a>and <a href="http://ubcb.blogspot.com/">here</a>. He also has amazing taste.<br /><br />Carl's current recommendation is for William H. <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Gass's</span> <strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781564785022">Cartesian Sonata and Other Novellas</a></em></strong>. Here's his favorite passage (from page 29): "All her senses were acute, but she could hear and see and feel most marvelously well: the tremor in her neighborâ€™s face, the scrape of cloud, the grumble of molasses, like her soul, folding from its bottle..."
