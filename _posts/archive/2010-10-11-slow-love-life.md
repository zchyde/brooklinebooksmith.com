Dominique Browning writes a blog of that title which is adapted from the title of her latest book.  <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781934633311">Slow Love  </a>is one of the current crop of books about stepping off the corporate carousel and reinventing.  In my opinion, hers is very good one the subject.  And I enjoy her blog a great deal.  Here's a <a href="http://www.slowlovelife.com/2010/10/john-lennons-70th-birthday-yoko-onos.html">link</a> to a recent posting.  It gave me a few moments of stillness here at whacky, wonderful, noisy Booksmith.
