Working backwards,<br />Ric's wiry words crunched my crowns<br />and <em>Unrequited</em> bought my breath,<br />for the length of the poem I was me of evening rehearsals half asleep classes and timing my passage between so that we could be face to face,  just for seven steps.  I don't remember where her locker was but I remember her profile, chin up brow down, unnecessary tiptoes as she reached for the top.<br /><br />Emily's spelling bee socks and her bold-on-the-inside girl with a master plan that makes no sense but will probably work if we can only get the rest of the story, you gotta give us the rest of the story, you know I won the school spelling bee two years running.  Can't spell arugala.<br /><br />Kate kills can you tell when you want to laugh, or is that your throat closing up, which is it, don't let on.  The silence that is born out of each poem is correct, neighbors not knowing if something is expected of them.  Don't let them off the hook, just say the words with your laughter and rage tongueing the air that delivers them.<br /><br />Eric took the big names and whipped them around the room so we all could take a swipe from our seats, and they swirled for a moment before coming to rest in a three part harmony of kisses first last and promised.<br /><br />Shoshanna took us up and set out to reframe and turn around, and her day will taste of Smarties while it waits for chocolate, and no question is really quite answered, even when you ask it twice, right?  And friends with bad breath are still friends.<br /><br />Evan's dream was ghostly and lyric, memories flowing mercurial through phone lines and "waist high libraries", wonderful idea, I imagined snow and sadness while he measured his breath a stately pace, planting each word footfall by footfall.<br /><br /><br /><br />I don't want to sit here and write, but that is what I'll do.  This is the juice that should be flowing in the studio, with paper and scissors and a big tray of paint on the floor before a sheet of wood leaning against the wall, where I'll remember my friends tonight, and what it takes for each of them to get up and open up their mouths so the deep down can be heard. <br />I hope I feel this good when I get home tonight, so I can pour a cup of this juice, mix it up with what I've got and make a cocktail that burns, so I can sing in fire and color.
