Goodnight Moon (board book)<br /><br />A few observations: <br /><br /><span style="font-family: Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"></span><br />Bostonians have a lot of hometown pride, and visitors to Boston are pretty proud, too. (<em>Good Night Boston</em> doesn't beat <em>Goodnight Moon</em> just anywhere.)<br /><br />Local schools&nbsp;have a lot of sway around here. <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em> attained its high position largely because of a school order, and a lot  of the (best) titles on the list were helped along by the Brookline  Schools' summer reading program. I'm looking at you, <em>Anna Hibiscus</em>, <em>Wonder</em>, and <em>The One and Only Ivan</em>.<br /><br />Speaking of <em>Anna Hibiscus</em>,  handselling is powerful. Many of us love this charming, funny&nbsp;chapter  book about a girl in "Africa, amazing Africa," and we recommend it to  fans of <em>Clementine</em> and <em>Ivy + Bean</em>. It's nice to know that a book can be a bestseller here even if it's not necessarily a bestseller nationally.<br /><br />Our  bestsellers aren't dominated by any age group or genre. There are  stories here of bullying, of demigods, of fights to the death on  fictional reality TV,&nbsp;of ducks who find homes and of crayons who quit.<br /><br />Our  customers know that a book doesn't have to be shiny-new to be worth  reading. They also know that if Jeff Kinney or Rick Riordan writes a new  book, it's time to run, not walk, to the bookstore.<br /><br />Movies  are good for books, at least from a sales perspective. (I'll leave the  debate on the artistic value of movie adaptations to you.)&nbsp;Popular new  books are good for an author's old books. (<em>Looking for Alaska</em> has sold better, both here and nationally, since the success of <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em> and of John Green's online platform than it did when it came our or when it won the Printz.)<br /><br />Elephant and Piggie will eventually take over the world.<br /><br />Adults have discovered YA in a big way. Heck, they've even discovered intermediate fiction. At least a few of the <em>Wonder</em> purchases were for adult book clubs, and I hear it's been a citywide read in some places.<br /><br />Still,  our number-one seller, kids' or YA, was the first book in an  intermediate series that's wildly popular with kids and has a  fairly&nbsp;small adult readership. Amazing as it is to see adults discover  our section, it's also nice to see that the kids' section is still about  kids.<br /><br />You have good taste, Brookline.<br /><br />Happy 2014.<br /> <br /></div>
