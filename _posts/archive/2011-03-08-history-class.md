I'm almost finished reading Erik Larson's new book (it comes out in May,) <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780307408846">In the Garden of Beasts</a>, about the American Ambassador to Germany and his family as they experienced Berlin in the early 1930's when Hitler was rising to power.  It is fascinating, engrossing, and just as I did with <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780375725609">Devil in the White City</a>, I am <em>really</em> learning about this particular slice of history.  Larson is filling in gaps for me, changing my perspective.<br /><br />He's also leading me to want to read more about this era, especially Hans <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Fallada</span>. Turns out, the daughter of the Ambassador knew Hans <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Fallada</span> through some friends and wrote a particularly detailed diary account (as it seemed everyone did at that time) about a visit she made to his house in the countryside.  As I was reading this chapter I thought, <em>Oh, hey!  It's that Hans <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Fallada</span> guy!  He has a book on our Books We Love table!</em>  I haven't read anything by him but now I most certainly will.  How could I not be interested when Larson and his diarists paint such a vivid picture of this world famous author about to live through one of the worst times in modern history?  Now I <em>need</em> to know! <br /><br />Erik Larson is the best.  Not only do I love his book, but he's got me wanting to absorb as much as I can about everyone he mentions.  I want to go to Berlin and walk down Tiergartenstrasse where the Ambassador lived.  I want to read everyone's diary.  I dare say he is the best teacher I've ever had.
