<div><div>It's Valentine's Day. Cards are flying off our racks, harried-looking men are running into our store with bouquets of flowers bought from Trader Joes, and my gentleman caller sent me a box full of B<a href="http://www.bonchon.com/" target="_blank">on Chon</a>&nbsp;chicken (all drumsticks!!!).</div><div><br /></div><div>Since I'm in the holiday spirit (and no longer ravenous for snacks) I'll dispense some advice for making a bookseller fall in love with you and your book. I hope you didn't think this was about making a bookseller actually fall in love with you, even though I think it would probably involve a lot of food and bookshelves we wouldn't be ashamed to merge with.<br /><br /><div><div style="text-align: right;"></div></div><div><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i4p6pZGC2B4/Uv6KhgA7trI/AAAAAAAACnI/SPk4Qx3C6Fc/s1600/image.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i4p6pZGC2B4/Uv6KhgA7trI/AAAAAAAACnI/SPk4Qx3C6Fc/s1600/image.jpeg" height="200" width="150" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Consider us <i>Kept</i>!</td></tr></tbody></table>1. Tell us we are pretty. I mean, don't tell <i>me</i>&nbsp;that, tell me that <i>the bookstore</i>&nbsp;is pretty.&nbsp;Tell us you like our selection, the recommendations we write, how pretty our colors are. We like compliments, and you'll see us blush a bit when you give us props for our spatial reasoning skills.&nbsp;</div></div></div><div><br /></div><div>2. Give us chocolates. We talk about food on a daily basis. It is not surprising to see booksellers pop their heads into the break room with a hopeful look that asks, "Are there snacks?" You haven't seen heartbreak until you see a hungry, snack-less bookseller who really wants a potato chip.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>James Scott (<i><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062236739" target="_blank">The Kept</a></i>)&nbsp;left us a kind note with chocolates. We liked him already, but we like him even more now. "I've worked at a bookstore before," he said. "I know about snacks." &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"></div><div><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_NZO5DcIAZw/Uv6KuNsk-yI/AAAAAAAACnQ/QS1ytW5bPgw/s1600/image+(1).jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_NZO5DcIAZw/Uv6KuNsk-yI/AAAAAAAACnQ/QS1ytW5bPgw/s1600/image+(1).jpeg" height="150" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">FirstSecond can do no wrong.</td></tr></tbody></table>3. Send us free books. I'll be honest--I love everything <a href="http://www.firstsecondbooks.com/" target="_blank">FirstSecond</a> puts out and I would have been talking about these books anyway, but since I have it now? My poor co-workers will be hearing about this book for months. (By the way, we're having an event with <a href="http://boxbrown.com/" target="_blank">Box Brown</a> for his illustrated bio of Andre the Giant on 7/1!)</div><div><br /></div><div>4. Be nice. I've put books at the forefront of my to-read list because an author was nice to me.</div><div><br /></div><div>5. Write a good book. &nbsp;This is really the most integral part of having us fall in love with you, and after you've created a work that we're bound to get excited over, send us chocolates.</div><div><br /></div><div>*Note: This is not a ploy to get more chocolates. &nbsp;Noooooooooo</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
