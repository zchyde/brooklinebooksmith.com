Sorry not to have updated last week--I've begun my buying for the summer which means I've been busier than usual. Of course it also means there's more that I want to tell you all about what's exciting coming up. I'm not sure how I'll do it, but I'll try!<br /><br />I haven't made mention of it (partly because I'm never happy to see anyone losing jobs or storefronts closing, partly because I'd like to spend my time focused on us more than our competition) but recently the Barnes and Noble down the street from us shut their doors. Dana, our fearless general manager and co-owner, wrote a little something about it for Shelf Awareness that you can read <a href="http://news.shelf-awareness.com/nview.jsp?appid=411&amp;j=609181">here </a>(scroll to the bottom).<br /><br />In other news I was able to read Temple <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Grandin's</span> <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780151014897"><strong><em>Animals Make Us Human</em></strong> </a>in time for our event last week (As suspected, I was working the register during her talk. I would insert a Debbie Downer <em><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">wah</span>-<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">wah</span></em> here but the popularity of the event meant we were piping audio through the whole store for those who couldn't fit downstairs so all was good. ). The book was wonderful and insightful and heartbreaking and, sadly, totally confirmed that my lifestyle is in no way <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">conducive</span> to owning a dog. I'm very glad that I get to pet all the dogs that come into our store and feed them biscuits or I would go crazy from doggy deprivation.
