Katie (comedienne, vegan chef extraordinaire, and master of our psychology and history sections) picked a classic sci-fi book for her recommendation--<a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781590172926"><strong><em>The Chrysalids</em></strong> </a>by John Wyndham.<br /><br />She says, "As if coming-of-age wasn't tricky enough, young David must keep his telepathic powers secret in a society where religious and genetic fundamentalists destroy anything that deviates from the norm. Thank you, New York Review of Books, for resurrecting this fantastic gripping tale."<br /><br />P.S.- Paul highly approves of this choice.<br />P.P.S.- Read more of Katie's recommendations <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=storepicks&amp;page=297610">here</a>
