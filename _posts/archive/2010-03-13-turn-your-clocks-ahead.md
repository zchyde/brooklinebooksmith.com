It's usually this time of year you can find me skimming several books in the self help section of the store...as I have what I can only describe as a reverse seasonal affect disorder.To console myself....I start thinking about <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">outdoorsie</span> stuff I know I will eventually want to do, once I have enough vitamin D metabolized to lift my spirits...some of these things are-<br /><br />-the produce is on its way back to affordability, and the farmers market is marching towards us...and I usually start thinking about changing my diet to something kinder...<br /><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/S5voEF2iTyI/AAAAAAAAABw/oh8YsHlKeYs/s1600-h/kind.jpg"><img style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; WIDTH: 128px; FLOAT: right; HEIGHT: 154px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5448203331222785826" border="0" alt="" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/S5voEF2iTyI/AAAAAAAAABw/oh8YsHlKeYs/s320/kind.jpg" /></a><br />-trips to New Hampshire (we have lots of great local travel/hiking books) This year I think I'd like to hike Lafayette.<br /><br />-grabbing a few used books and going to the park (Lars Anderson )<br /><br />-<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">cleaning</span> out my bookshelves and selling back all my good intentions to the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">UBC</span> (Wed-Sat 10-4) to make room and <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">resources</span> available for new good intentions<br /><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/S5vmqsbpHeI/AAAAAAAAABo/chMkLTXozsQ/s1600-h/b2r.jpg"><img style="MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; WIDTH: 128px; FLOAT: left; HEIGHT: 189px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5448201795390741986" border="0" alt="" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/S5vmqsbpHeI/AAAAAAAAABo/chMkLTXozsQ/s320/b2r.jpg" /></a><br />-reading an inspirational yet non-taxing adventure/ sports book ("Born to Run" comes to mind)<br /><br />Mostly I think this is the real time for resolutions, as it at least lines up with nature...isn't there a literary term coined by John Ruskin for that?
