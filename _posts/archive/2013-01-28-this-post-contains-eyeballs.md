In the world of children's and YA lit, all eyes...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0cLZ9nq7QlI/UQWaJevReUI/AAAAAAAAAHE/Ez1EvgSvi_w/s1600/1.27.13+004.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0cLZ9nq7QlI/UQWaJevReUI/AAAAAAAAAHE/Ez1EvgSvi_w/s320/1.27.13+004.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />...are on Seattle, where the American Library Association Midwinter&nbsp;Meeting is taking place. All weekend, committees of really knowledgeable people have&nbsp;held their final discussions about the stacks upon stacks upon I-always-say-I-have-too-many-stacks-and-I-can't-even-fathom-these-stacks of books they've read throughout the year, and at 8 a.m. Pacific Standard Time (in other words, not yet) they'll announce the winners of lots of awards, including the Caldecott, Newbery, and Printz.<br /><br />If we're really lucky, lots of the winners and honor books will be books we're already well aware of and have in stock in copious amounts. We'll all have already read them, and we'll all be ready to display them prominently and to rattle off explanations of why they're so amazing.<br /><br />But if we're lucky another way, the awards will bring books to our attention that we don't know much about. We already know of a lot of great books from this year, award winners or not, so winners we've never or barely heard of will just expand our repertoires. And if past performance is any indication, publishers are good at getting copies of the winners to us quickly.<br /><br />Either way, we're excited. Enjoy your Superbowl this weekend, folks. Ours is today.<br /><br />Edited to add: We have <a href="http://www.ala.org/news/pr?id=12298">winners</a>! The list includes quite a few of our favorites, so we're super-excited to sell them to you. Some of the titles are on hand already (including quite a few copies of Caldecott winner <em>This is Not My Hat</em> and Printz honoree <em>Code Name Verity</em>), and we should have the vast majority of the winners in the next few days. In the meantime, you'll find me doing my "Yay for <em>The One and Only Ivan</em>" dance, which looks a lot like frantically changing displays.
