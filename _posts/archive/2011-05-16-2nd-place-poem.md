Whose fingers<br />flipped these covers before revealing<br />the winter limbs of a writer's soul<br />full as pomegranate nipples tonight<br />can wait - upstairs a book sale;<br />we brush coats still damp<br />from the flurries outside and we are hungry<br />hungry hungry negotiating the book-bins.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Sasenarine Persaud is the author of 10 books.
