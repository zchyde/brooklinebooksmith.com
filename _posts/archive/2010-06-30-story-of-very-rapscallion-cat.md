Why you ask?  Because rhyme often gets forced and is too repetitive, which buries the story (if the so-called author was actually able to wedge one in there), creating a very murky text to wade through.  However, Dodd is able to engage lively characters through anapestic verse, rhyme, and alliteration, revealing their antics and quirks.  Slinky Malinki is a mischievous cat after night falls and he raises quite a ruckus beneath the moon.  Now, if you’re not a cat person, then there’s also <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781582460598">Hairy Maclary</a>, a cat-chasing but friendly shaggy black dog, from Donaldson’s Dairy.<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TCs1gdA50OI/AAAAAAAAAEA/MOyd5lIz0nM/s1600/slinky-malinki-1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 121px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TCs1gdA50OI/AAAAAAAAAEA/MOyd5lIz0nM/s320/slinky-malinki-1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5488539402541584610" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><br />“He crept along fences, / he leaped over walls, / he poked into corners / and sneaked into halls / What was he up to? […]”  Well, are you hooked yet?  You want to finish reading this <span style="font-style: italic;">Slinky Malinki </span>book, don’t you?<br /><br />Literature knows no bounds in this world – and I consider that a good thing!  I really wish more international books, such as these, did better over here in the states.  There are so many great titles abroad.  What if you never read British literature such as Michael Bond's <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780547133515">A Bear Called Paddington</a></span> or A.A. Milne's <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780525477686">Winnie-the-Pooh</a></span>?  Or how about no <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780375842207">Book Thief</a></span>, which originated in Australia?  Astrid Lindgren's <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780140309577">Pippi Longstocking</a></span> is a steady seller here at Booksmith.  This red-headed heroine originated in Sweden.  The troublesome puppet <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780140367089">Pinocchio</a></span> was originally Italian and <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780141322568">Heidi</a></span> is classic Swiss lit.  Plus, there's all those old folk and fairy tales (complete rabbit trail: Did you know Mother Goose's -- whose real name was Mary Goose --  <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=1498">grave</a> is in downtown Boston?)  My point?  Don't limit yourself to new titles.  Read classics.  Read old favorites.  Read books that began in another culture and see how similar we all really are.<br /><br />Armchair travel to places around the world...there's no passport required.
