<span class="Apple-style-span" >"<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; ">Cracks through the sunshite<br />Makes the world below look bitty kitty."<br />- Jackson Theriault, 4.5 years old, January, 2011.<br /><br />This morning when I picked him up from preschool, Jack's teacher made sure that he showed me his worksheet where he matched up the pictures of words that rhyme.  On the ride home I gave him words and asked him what words he could think of that rhymed with them.  It took him a while to really get the idea, but once he did his face lit up like he was on a Ferris wheel.  If you know Jack, that's about as good as it gets.<br /><br />"Ok Jack, what rhymes with street?"<br />"Well, S starts with street..."<br />Yup, and what <i>rhymes </i>with street?"<br />"Leet!"<br />"That's not a real word."<br />"Feet!"<br /><br />So now our unwitting poet knows how to rhyme. It took me about thirty-one years to voluntarily pick up a book of poetry, with the result that I find myself so lost in the ocean of poetry that every poem I read now either seems unbelievably brilliant and earth-shaking...or obnoxious. And now, as my reward for rejecting the art form, my son may very well embrace it, and I will finally receive the education that I so sorely need. </span></span>
