Hey guys, thanks so much for your interest in the galley giveaway; I only wish I had more so you all could get one!<br /><br />Congrats to Marie and Pam, who were each first for their respective titles! I've put your books behind the counter so come on in to pick them up. Since there were multiple requests, though, please come get them within the week or I'll offer them to the next in line. And do make sure to tell me if you like them!<br /><br />I'll try to do another galley grab soon, so do keep an eye out! And it's great to let me know what you're interested in--please do feel free to write me with what you like so I can offer up what would be of greatest appeal (and if you were a runner-up, please do send me an email and maybe I can find something else you'd like!).<br /><br />And remember that the Iain Pears is still up for grabs! **UPDATE** Sorry, but the Pears has been claimed as well. Jeremy, it'll be behind the register for you.<br /><br />Wow, there were a lot of exclamation points in this post. I'll try to be more restrained next time.
