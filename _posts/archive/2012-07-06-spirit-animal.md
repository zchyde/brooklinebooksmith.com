It's always a great icebreaker if you're socially awkward like me and you're just trying to get people to talk: ask them what their spirit animal is. And if they don't know, because they're grown-ups and they've never considered it, just throw a few crazy ones out there until one takes. Also there's that funny scene in Palahniuk's <i>Fight Club</i> where the character confronts his penguin spirit animal during a meditation.<br /><br />My spirit animal is a bunny rabbit. I'm not necessarily very tiny, timid or scared all the time. Nor do I procreate rapidly or have a particular fondness for parsley. But I think they're fluffy and cute and I like it when they scream. It's kinda badass. There's a really great bunny spirit animal in Paasilinna's <i>Year of the Hare</i>, where the main character Vatanen rejects his material comforts (job, girlfriend, city apartment) to take up with a bunny in the Finnish wilderness. Here's artist Fabrice Backes' interpretation of the book:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-027bKOa1AKo/T_W3lB0k7AI/AAAAAAAAAiw/9vdW4w524D8/s1600/fbackes-lievrevatanen.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="235" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-027bKOa1AKo/T_W3lB0k7AI/AAAAAAAAAiw/9vdW4w524D8/s320/fbackes-lievrevatanen.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><span style="background-color: white;">Wouldn't you want to cuddle with that bunny?!</span><br /><br />Just this last week in the UBC we got a ton of great books with awesome animal-themed covers, and it sort of blows the whole spirit animal business open. Like, why <i>just </i>be exemplified by a piglet, classic symbol of virility and strength, but instead choose to be a pig with a pierced nose and big bow tie, like this fancy dancer on the cover of a Wodehouse novel that is now on the top of my to-read list:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-N5nGNBk88_U/T_W0SPoMeyI/AAAAAAAAAig/SD31HpJIryg/s1600/wodehouse.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-N5nGNBk88_U/T_W0SPoMeyI/AAAAAAAAAig/SD31HpJIryg/s320/wodehouse.JPG" width="214" /></a></div><br /><span style="background-color: white;">Maybe you're this wacky bird with long legs and a confident gait:</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x0fZJ47HBTQ/T_W1UsAPX6I/AAAAAAAAAio/Q4cxHJCVEcM/s1600/snoring.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x0fZJ47HBTQ/T_W1UsAPX6I/AAAAAAAAAio/Q4cxHJCVEcM/s320/snoring.jpg" width="215" /></a></div><br />But really, if given the choice, the only animal from all of literature to truly emulate is Behemoth from Bulgakov's <i>Master and Margarita</i>. He's my favorite cat in literature. He's one of Satan's henchmen. He has a proclivity for chess, vodka and firearms, and he wears fancy pince-nez glasses. And he's super sarcastic and hardcore.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Up7YDPykD9A/T_W3rdYLO1I/AAAAAAAAAi4/QeZGf2-MaMs/s1600/master-and-margarita.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Up7YDPykD9A/T_W3rdYLO1I/AAAAAAAAAi4/QeZGf2-MaMs/s320/master-and-margarita.jpg" width="297" /></a></div>
