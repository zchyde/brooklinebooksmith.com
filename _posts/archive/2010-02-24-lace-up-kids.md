I'm here to comment on the interesting things that come up in the children’s section here at the Booksmith. <span style="font-size:+0;"></span> This week’s selection is _Lace Up!_ put out by DK publishing.

Okay, so it’s not a great work of literature, but it is pretty cool! <span style="font-size:+0;"></span> Every other lacing card sets and books, on learning how to tie a shoe, are quite boring. If I wanted to connect the dots, I’d get an activity book, thank you. But this book has a pop up shoe! <span style="font-size:+0;"></span> Don’t worry, this fake Converse shoe is actually pretty durable. _Lace Up!_ also has other lacing games in it, as well as teaching you how to properly thread a button.

Come in and check it out!

We don’t just sell children’s literature, we sell…life skills.
