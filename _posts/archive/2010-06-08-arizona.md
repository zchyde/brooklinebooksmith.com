But I just wanted to take a sec and talk about the reactions to the lunacy running rampant in Arizona. <div><br /></div><div>The picture above is of one of my favorite bands of all time, Hall and Oates. Little did I know that, in addition to being in possession of the world's most serious mustache and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anLfoy2XsFw">making the best music video of all time</a>, the smooth duo are real American patriots. Yesterday, they cancelled their concert in Arizona, proving that participation in American Idol does not preclude political responsibility. If I were in charge of these things, I would declare June 7th Hall and Oates Day. Hats off to you, John and Darryl. You're making Mama proud.</div><div><br /></div><div>On a more serious note, reading Roger Ebert's reaction to <a href="https://wonkette.com/415809/arizona-school-demands-black-latino-students-faces-on-mural-be-changed-to-white#ixzz0qHNb3Ks6">the mural incident</a> marked the first time a blog post has ever moved me to tears. In <a href="https://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/06/how_would_i_feel_if.html">his beautiful essay</a>, he imagines what it must be like for the children depicted in the painting whose skin was lightened after people yelled racial slurs while driving by their school AT THE BEHEST OF AN ELECTED OFFICIAL. Ebert then reflects on the way his understanding of different people grew and changed throughout the years. If I were in charge of these things, I would give Ebert a humanitarian award for awesomeness. </div><div><br /></div><div>Ebert sums up my understanding of the situation at the end of his essay:<span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"> "</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;">They simply hate. Why would they do that?"</span></span></div>
