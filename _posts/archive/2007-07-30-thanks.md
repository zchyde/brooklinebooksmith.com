I just wanted to say thank you to all the wonderful folks who decided to join us for Potterpalooza last week. I know that you have so many choices for where to buy your books (especially that one in particular!), and I truly feel honored by those who choose to buy their books from us.<br /><br />As for me, I finished last night--very bittersweet.
