Zee, a Marxist literary scholar, and her husband Doug  move into the coach house of Laurelfield, her family’s 100-year-old estate. Doug  is supposedly writing a biography about poet Edwin Parfitt but actually spends  most of his time falling in love with Zee’s step-brother’s wife, writing teen  novels for a book packaging company, and trying to break into Laurelfield’s  attic, which holds records of the arts colony based there in the 1920’s. As the  narrative zips back in time, we learn the secrets of Laurelfield, hidden from  Doug but laid bare to the reader in an immensely satisfying literary scavenger  hunt.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Thursday, July 17 at 7pm</div><div><strong>Small Press Book Club</strong></div><div>Our new book club selects readings from independent presses.

Historian and witch Dana Bishop and vampire scientist Matthew  Clairmont are back and reunited with the cast of characters from A Discovery of  Witches, with one important exception. As they search for Ashmole 782 and its  missing pages, Dana and Matthew draw ever closer to learning what the witches  discovered centuries ago. From ancestral homes to university laboratories, with  a mix of ancient knowledge and modern science, <em>The Book of Life</em> brings  the All Souls Trilogy to a satisfying end.</div><br /><div><div>Saturday, July 19 at 10:30am</div><div><strong>Children's Storytime</strong></div><div>Do you love picture books?
