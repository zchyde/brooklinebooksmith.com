Some of the creme de la creme of their offerings are now released in book format here in the States. De Botton's <i>How to Think More About Sex </i>and psychologist Phillipa Perry's <i>How to Stay Sane</i>&nbsp;are the first of a forthcoming series of books that will teach you how to live a better life, "free from dogma." One of my favorite offerings of the School of Life, that is perhaps not much different from the commonplace task of a bookseller though more formal, is bibliotherapy.<br /><br />The concept of Bibliotherapy is that you submit your ills or interests or preoccupations with a designated bibliotherapist who will prescribe books to help you cope, process or escape. Whatever you need! According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliotherapy">Wikipedia&nbsp;</a>it's been around since the ancient Greeks (which makes all my life choices legitimate). I like this concept a lot, perhaps because in an on-the-fly sense it's what booksellers do all day. But I like the idea that there are certain books to cure your ills or at least alleviate the symptoms.<br /><br />Lacking spice in your marriage? We've got <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover </i>by D. H. Lawrence!<br /><br />Sick of the rain outside? Read <i>Dune </i>by Frank Herbert.<br /><br />Need a laugh? How about George Saunders' <i>Pastoralia?</i><br /><i><br /></i>Getting over the loss of a loved one? Paul Auster's <i>New York Trilogy</i> might help.<br /><br />Need to create more boundaries for yourself? Let Bronte's <i>Jane Eyre </i>inspire you.<br /><br />Irrational fears got you down? Max Brooks' <i>World War Z</i> might allay things.<br /><br />Government bumming you out? How about <i>V for Vendetta</i> by Alan Moore?<br /><br />Mourning the transition from childhood to adulthood? We have a grip of Peanuts, Garfield and Calvin &amp; Hobbes comics.<br /><br />Come into the UBC and save mad money on your psychiatry bills!
