One of my favorite parts about working in a bookstore is meeting authors, especially when they come in to sign stock. On paper, stock signings sound boring: an author, a Sharpie, and putting signed stickers on books.&nbsp; In reality, stock signings are the best, especially when it's with an author whose work you admire. It's usually just the two of you, and it's a bit overwhelming sometimes!<br /><br />Today, I got to meet Hervé Tullet as he signed his new book, <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/apachesolr_search/herve%20tullet" target="_blank"><i>I Am Blop</i></a>, in addition to several of his other titles.&nbsp; He charmed our entire store, sitting down at our children's table, taking out his pack of markers, and delving into a really colorful signing.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cdE1Er0JoLw/UWWxmTB7GJI/AAAAAAAAA54/otVsNrXug2g/s1600/AD3C8353-6E6C-4B5A-BFF2-2BE37196E739.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cdE1Er0JoLw/UWWxmTB7GJI/AAAAAAAAA54/otVsNrXug2g/s320/AD3C8353-6E6C-4B5A-BFF2-2BE37196E739.JPG" width="239" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Booksellers were peeking around the corner because Hervé's signatures required space to dry and perhaps an events director with spatial reasoning skills (hello!).</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MJHTMikv5Bc/UWWyET7S5DI/AAAAAAAAA6I/Rl__M-ho5c0/s1600/84098C50-771A-4BAA-8618-D7FCFC6E2DC0.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pQW4ARBjncA/UWWx20nONoI/AAAAAAAAA6A/Ts-kZ5nKsWY/s320/1403E1B8-A866-4617-A844-757AF8C8EF2E.JPG" width="239" />&nbsp; <img border="0" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MJHTMikv5Bc/UWWyET7S5DI/AAAAAAAAA6I/Rl__M-ho5c0/s320/84098C50-771A-4BAA-8618-D7FCFC6E2DC0.JPG" width="239" /> </a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>So cool.&nbsp; Get them now, before this becomes the bookseller covet-and-must-have book of the week! <br /><br />
