It's August. &nbsp;Boston empties out, people who haven't yet squandered their vacation time have fled, the city is quiet (ish) and waiting for September when Boston's population explodes. &nbsp;This is the perfect time of year for putting shenanigans onto the Booksmith event calendar, when we take off our glasses and party like it's 1999.<br /><br />BOOKSMITH STAFF TALENT SHOW*<br />Friday, August 23rd at 7pm<br />A lot of really interesting, talented people work here. &nbsp;In addition to a slew of writers, we have cosplayers, comedians, artists, all sorts of people, but no jugglers. I really wanted there to be a juggler on staff, really really badly. I'm going to be reading a sestina I wrote for Shuchi about spatial reasoning, Amy will be doing her stick figure drawings, Ric and Jodie have signed up to read poetry and prose, Katie will be making a brilliant short film, and rumor has it Jes is searching for her childhood clarinet. I don't think anyone will be singing, but that's because...<br /><br />TURN AROUND BRIGHT EYES<br />A Reading with Rob Sheffield Sandwiched by Karaoke Hours<br />Saturday, August 17th at 7pm<br />I read <i>Love is A Mix Tape</i>&nbsp;years ago, cried, and fell head-over-heels for <i>Rolling Stone </i>writer Rob Sheffield and his deceased wife. &nbsp;Let's be honest with ourselves, this guy can write. Fast forward to a few months ago when I learned of Rob's new book, <i>Turn Around Bright Eyes: The Rituals of Love and Karaoke</i>. &nbsp;The karaoke party didn't really appear in my brain, rather, it climbed onto a cloud playing Hall and Oates and settled gently onto my shoulders. &nbsp;Want to get in on this? E-mail events@brooklinebooksmith.com with the subject heading KARAOKE! and your top 3 song choices to be assigned a time slot. &nbsp;If you don't, Rob Sheffield may be subjected to two straight hours of me singing a Hall and Oates medley and he may never return to the Boston area. &nbsp;Come on guys. &nbsp;Do it for Rob.<br /><br />BABAYAGA<br />A Reading with Toby Barlow<br />Thursday, August 8 at 7pm<br />There aren't any overt shenanigans connected to this event, and it's technically the most 'normal' reading out of the ones I've listed here. I loved <i>Sharp Teeth</i>&nbsp;and I really adore <i>Babayaga</i>, which is the most shenanigan-laced book I've read in quite a while, and this is coming from the woman who has been steadily consuming Doctor Who mass markets this entire summer. &nbsp;You should go.<br /><br />*If you know how to juggle and would like to juggle in the Booksmith Staff Talent Show, please e-mail events@brooklinebooksmith.com with the subject header: I Am The Juggler You've Been Searching For. &nbsp;Please include a brief description of your most adventurous juggling attempt to date.
