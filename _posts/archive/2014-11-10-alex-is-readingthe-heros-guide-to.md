Hi! I'm Alex. Nice to meet you. I've been working in the kids section for a couple months and now I am going to blog to you, with book lists, and approximate age recommendations that you can totally disregard.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eouX1vzWxaE/VGDYBFoRz2I/AAAAAAAAAA8/uNS6TJZNfRE/s1600/Ref%3Ddp_image_0.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eouX1vzWxaE/VGDYBFoRz2I/AAAAAAAAAA8/uNS6TJZNfRE/s1600/Ref%3Ddp_image_0.jpeg" /></a></div>Today I am reading <b>THE HERO'S GUIDE TO SAVING YOUR KINGDOM by Christopher Healy</b> *Kylie Recommends*. This is a funny book. No, it is: it's about a bunch of hapless fairy tale Prince Charmings wandering around the countryside trying to accomplish things but mostly just getting in trouble. It is also about fairy tale princesses having strong opinions. I am a big fan of ALL these princesses, including the mean one. There are polite giants, punk kid Bandit Kings, genius little sisters, and dragons. This book is great. (It is also good for ages 9+ and as of this writing you can find it in our intermediate fiction section.)<br /><br />In keeping with this awesome book I am reading and enjoying greatly, here are a few more books you might like if you like...<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><b>FAIRY TALE BOOKS </b></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b><br /></b></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>The Paper Bag Princess by Robert Munsch</b> -- Was this the first book about a princess that does what she wants? It's definitely one of the best. Girl meets dragon, girl beats dragon, girl ignores a disappointed prince to run off into the sunset an independent hero. We usually have this as a board book and in our spinner rack. 2+</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>Beauty and the Beast and other fairy tale picture books by Ursula Jones and Sarah Gibb</b> *Clarissa Recommends* -- Absolutely stunning illustrations over excellent, traditional fairy tale retellings. Check our folk lore/mythology section for these--they're often on display! 3+</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>The Princess in Black by Shannon Hale, Dean Hale, and LeUyen Pham</b> *Alex Recommends* -- GO NOW AND READ THIS BOOK. Princess Magnolia is a  dainty pink-wearing hostess with perfect manners...but she becomes the  heroic PRINCESS IN BLACK to fight monsters and rescue sheep herders! You  can find it in young chapterbooks--recommended ages 5+. Good for young  independent readers.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>Dealing With Dragons by Patricia C. Wrede </b>*Alex Recommends* -- Princess Cimorene doesn't want to embroider or get married to a boring prince. Or any other prince. So she runs away from home to work for dragon Kazul, fights a lot of wizards, and learns to make a mean cherries jubilee. 10+</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>Twice Upon A Time series by Wendy Mass</b> -- Retold fairy tales by the author of <b>The Candymakers</b>. 8+ </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine</b> *Alex Recommends* -- Absolutely my favorite fairytale retelling ever. This Cinderella is "blessed" by a fairy as a baby...to obey every single direct order that's given to her for her entire life. Ella is brilliant. You will read this book over and over. 9+</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>Summer and Bird by Katherine Catmull</b> *Alex Recommends* -- This is a weird, beautiful book. Two girls find their parents missing--their mother is the swan princess and their father took her feathered skin. They travel into a world of only birds, where a vicious, terrifying false queen is asserting her power--a queen Bird falls for like Edmund and the White Witch in <b>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</b>. 10+</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>Howl's Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones</b> *Amy Recommends* -- Everyone buys into the fairy tale stereotypes in Sophie's town, and it's clear she's going to be a docile hatmaking third sister forever. WAIT, NO SHE'S NOT. She's going to be cursed by a witch to look like an old woman and run off on an adventure in the moving magical house of the dread wizard Howl, who as it turns out is the most obnoxious wizard ever. Stop here for sentient scarecrows, fire demons, and wizards obsessed with their hair. 10+</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>Ever After High series by Shannon Hale </b>-- Shannon Hale writes the best fairy tale retellings. This series is good for 10+.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><b>Ash by Malinda Lo</b> *Anna Recommends* -- A YA Cinderella story with POC main characters, beguiling fairies, personal strength, and a Cinderella who falls in love, not with a prince, but his Huntress. 13+<br /><br /><b>Cruel Beauty by Rosamund Hodge</b> <b>*</b>Clarissa Recommends* -- A sharp, fierce, beguiling Beauty and the Beast story about a demon prince and one angry beauty. 14+<br /><br /><b>Poisoned Apples by Christine Hepperman</b> *Alex Recommends* -- This poetry collection uses the language of fairy tales to take on the pressures and pains of being a teenage girl. Watch out--there's some dark and personal stuff in this little book--but its intensity is full of truth and Hepperman has a excellent grip on her language. 14+<br /><br /><b>Cinder by Marissa Meyer</b> *Kylie Recommends* -- Welcome to cyborg Cinderella. This is a very cool scifi take on the story, and the first of a series. 13+ <br /><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>&nbsp;</b>Happy reading!</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><br /><br /><br /><br />
