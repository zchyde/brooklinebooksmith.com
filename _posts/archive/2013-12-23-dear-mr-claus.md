<div dir="ltr">I've never written to you before, and I'm not going to start asking  for things now. I just wanted to say thanks for some gifts that have  already arrived this year. If anyone else is responsible, I hope you'll  relay my gratitude; I'm told you've got connections.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Thank you, Mr. Claus, for the slew of smart, fun picture books this year.  Books like <i>Xander's Panda Party </i>for young biologists; <i>Rosie Revere,  Engineer</i> for young logical thinkers; and <i>The Day the Crayons Quit</i> for  young artists and activists.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Thank you for the kinds of intermediate novels that <i>Wonder  </i>made cool, like <i>Counting by Sevens</i> and <i>The Thing About Luck</i>; for Greek  gods and wimpy kids who bring the young readers to us in droves; and for  the classics that parents and grandparents are still bursting to share. Every time <i>Anne of Green Gables </i>rings up, an angel gets her wings.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Thank you for <a href="https://brooklinebooksmith.blogspot.com/2013/12/todays-teens-will-be-running-world-soon.html">YA that never forgets to be awesome</a>.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Thank you for knowledgeable, generous, funny coworkers, and for customers who express joy when they see us busy.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Enjoy the holiday, Mr. Claus. And if you need a few more  book suggestions for the children of the world, my impression is that  you know where to find us. We'll leave the milk and cookies in the break  room.&nbsp;</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Yours merrily,</div><div dir="ltr">An appreciative children's bookseller </div>
