"Do you have any  Captain Underpants books here?"<br /><br /><em>oh yeah, sure.<br /><br /></em>"Oh, PHEEEW!!"<br /><br /><br /><br />So, just now, there was that.<br />And then earlier this week, my son:<br /><br />"Dad, do you want me to tell you a story?"<br /><br /><em>of course.<br /><br /></em>"There was an elephant tiger, with stripes, and then he turned into a chair lamp, and he fell down the table, and thpt hoyba pupu he BONK!"<br /><br /><em>jackson, that was awesome.<br /><br /></em>"Dad, do you want me to tell you another story?"<br /><br /><em>of course!<br /><br /><br /></em>And in between, Kendrick Perkins got traded, Qaddafi showed his true colors, Christchurch shook, and I took the kids out to stomp in giant, shivering puddles.   <br />Get in touch with me if you can find anything that holds this post together.
