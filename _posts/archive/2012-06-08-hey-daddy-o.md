<br />Father's Day is nigh, and to celebrate, here are a few famous dad-and-son literary duos:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UQiBy593wVk/T9IVpuDvOjI/AAAAAAAAAfA/xZMTrRCNu8w/s1600/myers.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="204" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UQiBy593wVk/T9IVpuDvOjI/AAAAAAAAAfA/xZMTrRCNu8w/s320/myers.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><b>Walter Dean Myers and&nbsp;Christopher Myers.</b> Walter Dean Myers has written <i>hundreds</i>&nbsp;of books for young adults and his artist son has made a plethora of his own picture books in a bold style. Christopher even does his own version of Carroll's <i>Jabberwocky</i>&nbsp;that is super cool.<br /><br /><b>Ernest Hemingway and Mariel Hemingway.</b> Granddaughter of Papa Hemingway herself Mariel has written a few books, mostly memoirs and health books. Though she is mostly an actress and activist, but we can get behind that.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xOUR6Z4QBdU/T9IVZmiizbI/AAAAAAAAAe4/JwHMkprr35I/s1600/amis.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xOUR6Z4QBdU/T9IVZmiizbI/AAAAAAAAAe4/JwHMkprr35I/s200/amis.jpg" width="177" /></a></div><b>Kingsley Amis and Martin Amis.</b> Martin grew up under the tutelage of a literary heavyweight, and has made his own unique name for himself. Apparently Kingsley hasn't always been too impressed by his son's novels, though, complaining once:&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can point out the exact place where he stopped and sent Money twirling through the air; that's where the character named Martin Amis comes in...Breaking the rules, buggering about with the reader, drawing attention to himself." Maybe Martin forgot to take out the trash that day?<br /><br /><b>Leo Dillon and Lee Dillon. </b>Unfortunately, Leo Dillon, the gentlemanly half of married artist duo Leo and Diane Dillon passed away recently, but the artists did collaborate with their son Lee, an accomplished photographer. <i>Pish Posh, Hieronymous Bosch </i>features Bosch-style framed paintings by the&nbsp;couple&nbsp;photographed by their son.<br /><br /><b>Stephen King and Joe Hill.</b>&nbsp;The son of horror legend King has written a couple of moody, atmospheric novels with dark twists. He did so, too, without outing himself as King's son and earning critical acclaim before a reviewer caught on.
