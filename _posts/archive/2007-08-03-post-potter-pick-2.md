Still in hardcover, but definitely worth a look.</div><br /><div></div><br /><div><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9781416935711"><strong><em>H.I.V.E.: Higher Institute of Villainous Education</em></strong><br /></a>By Mark Walden<br /><br />H.I.V.E is a secret school designed to educate children who are just a little too bright and mischievous in the finer points of evil. Otto, who has unwillingly been enrolled, tries to escape with the help of friends Wing, Laura, and Shelby, each with their own unique ‘talents.’ This is a fun thrill ride that makes you want to get in line for the sequel right away! (approx. grade 4-7)</div><br /><div></div><br /><div>If evil is your bag, baby (thank you, Austin Powers), another book that came out recently is <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780152059880"><strong><em>Evil Genius</em></strong> </a>by Catherine Jinks (approx. grade 6-8). I enjoyed this one, though I have to admit that it didn't fully live up to the expectations I had for it. But I still give it a solid recommendation. </div><br /><div></div><br /><div>Also, faithful reader Tricia suggested the Percy Jackson series as another fantastic Post-Potter pick. I couldn't agree more! I love, love, love these books (as mentioned <a href="http://brooklinebooksmith.blogspot.com/2007/05/titles-for-kids.html">here</a>). </div><br /><div></div>
