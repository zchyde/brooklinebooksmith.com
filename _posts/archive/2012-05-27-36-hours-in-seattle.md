I had a lot of family to see, so I had to limit my time in Seattle to 36 hours, but there's a lot one can do in 36 hours in Seattle!

And of course, if you've never been to Seattle before, then Pike Place Market and the Space Needle are probably musts. But if you've lived in the Emerald City, and it's been a while since you've been back, then your trip might look a little different.<br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">Read my&nbsp;<b>36 Hours in Seattle</b> itinerary&nbsp;<a href="http://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/2012/05/27/36-hours-in-seattle/">on globecorner.com</a>!</span>
