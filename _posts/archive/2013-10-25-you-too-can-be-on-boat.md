The deals are on now and what better way to see swaths of the world AND get away from it all at the same time? I've set up a small subsection at the beginning of our Europe section for cruise guidebooks.

This is a great book to by right now as you start to plan your cruise. There are reviews of all the lines, itineraries, ideas for how to spend your time both on and off the boat, and while some details may need refreshing over the years, you could really hold on to this for future ideas for planning. This could be your Mediterranean cruise year, and next could be your Alaskan cruise year, and the same Berlitz book could guide you to all your coming adventures.</div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><em><strong><a data-mce-href="http://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/9781612385891.jpg" href="http://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/9781612385891.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignleft  wp-image-9665" data-mce-src="http://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/9781612385891-168x300.jpg" data-mce-style="margin: 10px;" height="108" src="http://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/9781612385891-168x300.jpg" style="border: 0px; cursor: default; float: left; margin: 10px;" title="9781612385891" width="61" /></a><a data-mce-href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781612385891" href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781612385891">Rick Steves Northern European Cruise Ports</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781612385068" href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781612385068">Mediterranean Cruise Ports</a></strong></em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rick Steves guides are great in general, but particularly on a cruise, if you're a do-it-yourselfer, a little budget conscious and a really excited, open-minded sort of person his guidebooks are AMAZING. Enough information that you can go through even the most overwhelming museums on your own, useful phrases in the back to make a friendly impression on the locals, and exhaustive, frank and practical reviews on everything from where to eat, when it's worth booking an on-shore excursion through the ship, and what is missable and unmissable both on the ship and off. Great for those travelling with or without families, and if you prefer investing your money in lifetime memories over fancy digs.</div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-9663 alignleft" data-mce-src="http://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/9780891419471-194x300.jpg" data-mce-style="margin: 10px;" height="85" src="http://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/9780891419471-194x300.jpg" style="border: 0px; cursor: default; float: left; margin: 10px;" title="9780891419471" width="55" /><a data-mce-href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780891419471" href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780891419471"><em><strong>Fodor's European Cruise Ports of Call</strong></em></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're maybe cruising without the kids, if you enjoy the finer things in life, if you have a membership to the MFA AND the Gardner, and would spend a premium for hotels with high-thread-count sheets, Fodor's guides might be speaking your language. Exhaustive guides to the major ports of all the major cruise lines, tips for the sort of food you would eat to have a culinary experience, NOT to run home and tell horror stories about, tips for maximizing your museum and shopping trips in your quick city jaunts at each port. We have them in for Europe and new editions for Alaska and the Carribbean are on the way!</div>
