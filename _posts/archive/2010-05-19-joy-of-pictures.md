There is always one unexpected book that appears.  This week’s pick? Anouck Boisrobert and Louis Rigaud’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Popville</span>.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Popville</span> is a new intricately designed pop-up book that follows the development of one house in the country.  But what happens when more and more buildings surround this little house?  My favorite part about <span style="font-style: italic;">Popville</span> is that it’s a wordless picturebook. <br /><br />Ah, wordless pictures!  I love ‘em.  But, unfortunately, so many people really don’t understand the essence of them.  “They’re not really stories…”  “Oh, those are for babies…”  “There’s nothing to read in it…”  “You can’t do anything with them…”  I’ve heard all of the excuses…stop it! <br /><br />I can write a five page paper just on one page spread, so I’ll just say this:  Wordless picturebooks help children to expand their art and story telling skills.  It’s not just words that make up great stories, right?  It’s also the illustrations.  Pictures provide details that words can’t say and also portrays what does not need to be said.  One time a three year old, whom I was babysitting for at the time, asked me what a character liked to do for fun.  So, we went through the book just looking at the pictures.  She had so much fun discovering more about this character.  Plus, I’ve heard other parents say <span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 153);">wordless picturebooks are great because it’s the child’s turn to read the story</span> to them (even if their child cannot yet read).<br /><br /><object style="background-image: url(http://i4.ytimg.com/vi/Kd2U4mN10gQ/hqdefault.jpg);" height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Kd2U4mN10gQ&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Kd2U4mN10gQ&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1" allowscriptaccess="never" allowfullscreen="true" wmode="transparent" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="344" width="425"></embed></object><br /><br /><br /><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">More Awesome Wordless Picturebooks</span></span><span style="font-style: italic;"><br />Wave</span> by Suzy Lee<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Goodnight Gorilla</span> by Peggy Rathmann<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">You Can't Take a Balloon into the Museum of Fine Arts </span>by Jacqueline Preiss Weitzman and Robin Glasser<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Lion and Mouse</span> (Caldecott Winner 2010) by Jerry Pinkney<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Flotsam</span> by David Wiesner<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Grey Lady and the Strawberry Snatcher </span>by Molly Bang
