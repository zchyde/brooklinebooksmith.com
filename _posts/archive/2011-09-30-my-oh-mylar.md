<em>from the bowels of the Booksmith, another installment of life in the Used Book Cellar</em><br /><br />Thursday was a quiet, rainy day in the Booksmith, and my colleague Carl found a treasure while digging around in our overstock space: a box of MYLAR! For those that don't know the technical term, you definitely know what Mylar is, I promise. Mylar is the plastic wrap that folds around the dust jacket of a hardcover book. Libraries use it like gangbusters to protect dust jackets for the ages, and now that we've found a grip of it ourselves, we'll be using it to fancy up books in the UBC. <br /><br /><em>But I thought you didn't buy used hardcovers?</em> you might ask. WELL. That is mostly true. Typically, hardcover books don't fly off our shelves once the paperback is available,&nbsp;so by-and-large we don't buy a large amount. However, there are exceptions to every rule, and in this case, there are exactly three reasons we'll consider buying a hardcover:<br /><br />1) It's a super-hot title (think, <em>Dance of Dragons</em> by George R. R. Martin) that is only currently available in hardcover, we'll consider it based on condition.<br /><br />2) It's a classic or super-interesting book--with a dust jacket--that readers might want to have in their collections (think <em>Jane Eyre</em> by Charlotte BrontÃ«).<br /><br />3) It's a cookbook or art book, which are frequently&nbsp;printed only in hardcover.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6hZ2FcTOb2M/ToT2iQrk_fI/AAAAAAAAAIM/Z7fdGhEPtGY/s1600/nycover.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; cssfloat: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" kca="true" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6hZ2FcTOb2M/ToT2iQrk_fI/AAAAAAAAAIM/Z7fdGhEPtGY/s200/nycover.jpg" width="161" /></a></div>So now, for those rare, interesting, beautiful, unique, quasi-collectible books, we can fancy them up with mylar covers. Carl and I spent the quiet, rainy morning mylar-ing a stack of books, and these treasures now have a new lease on life! They feel nice and new, they're protected from aging (the mylar comes with an acid-free, archival backing) and they are shiny! And whom among us does not love shiny things?! <br /><br />I've posted a photo of one example, <em>Here is New York</em> by E. B. White. A classic essay on the Big Apple by one of America's treasures was already a cool find, but now it shines like the city herself! But a photograph can't do these books justice, you gotta feel how slick these things are! Come in and check 'em out!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y3xUxT7ugOQ/ToT4ZfF5ZwI/AAAAAAAAAIg/mXSGkaJWDWE/s1600/scroll.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; cssfloat: right; float: right; height: 103px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; width: 162px;"><img border="0" height="200" kca="true" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y3xUxT7ugOQ/ToT4ZfF5ZwI/AAAAAAAAAIg/mXSGkaJWDWE/s200/scroll.jpg" width="200" /></a></div>To add a human element to this gripping tale, your used book buyers, Carl and Natasha (that's me!) used some of the excess mylar backing to offer you a chance to get to know us. Following are the transcripts of the question-and-answer session we scrawled Kerouac-style on these fancy scrolls.<br /><br /><strong>Natasha's survey for Carl:</strong><br />N: What did gas cost when you started at the Booksmith?<br />C: $2.75<br /><em>[Carl's been with us since May 2000! --Ed.]</em><br /><br />N: Unicorns or zombies?<br />C: I have nothing funny to say here<br /><br />N: How do you say "Happy Birthday" in Japanese?<br />C: Happy Birthday in Japanese<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Y3ISGAY96I4/ToT5fS7YNUI/AAAAAAAAAIk/W6VqPgyPUZw/s1600/natasha.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; cssfloat: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" kca="true" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Y3ISGAY96I4/ToT5fS7YNUI/AAAAAAAAAIk/W6VqPgyPUZw/s320/natasha.jpg" width="124" /></a></div>N: Draw a bunny<br />C: <em>[see image. the bunny is eating a carrot. --Ed.]</em><br /><br />N: Can you make a book without using scissors?<br />C: Yep. Also without hands.<br /><em>[Carl runs his own literary press! Check out <a href="http://greyingghost.tumblr.com/">Greying Ghost here</a>! --Ed.]</em><br /><br />N: Is there anything you <em>can't </em>do?<br />C: Lay off the sweets<br /><br />N: Who would win in a fight: Henry Miller or Norman Mailer?<br />C: Are they nude? If so, I'd say Kerouac.<br /><em>[We mylared Mailer today! --Ed.]</em><br /><br />N: Any advice for the youth of today?<br />C: Be kind and rewind. Unless you're using DVDs. In that case, don't scratch 'em up. They're technically not mine.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z3L151znQbI/ToT3vCQFEiI/AAAAAAAAAIc/_IFqoy5j6aY/s1600/carl.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; cssfloat: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" kca="true" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z3L151znQbI/ToT3vCQFEiI/AAAAAAAAAIc/_IFqoy5j6aY/s320/carl.jpg" width="155" /></a></div><strong>Carl's survey for Natasha:</strong><br />C: If Sartre went to an AC/DC show, would he&nbsp;be miserable or relish in the ambiance?<br />N: He'd stand in the corner derisively. And bum smokes from the roadies.<br /><em>[Carl likes classic rock and I majored in Philosophy as an undergrad. --Ed.]</em><br /><br />C: Do you have Focus on Grammar 4?<br />N: Yes!<br /><em>[We got our shipment in! And we carry all kinds of books for Brookline Adult Education. --Ed.]</em><br /><br />C: What is it like basking in my Greatness?<br />N: Every day is like eating marshmallows covered in sprinkles while petting bunnies.<br /><em>[Fun Fact, my favorite animal is a bunny! --Ed.]</em><br /><br />C: What gets your Goat?<br />N: usually a tin can<br /><br />C: Have you seen my house keys? I sort of need them.<br />N: Did you check near the recycling?<br /><br />C: Philosophy--powerful motivational tool or a bunch of Mumbo-Jumbo?<br />N: depends on whether it's American or French.<br /><br />C: Did you take your funny pills today? Cuz you are OD'ing.<br />N: Today is somehow different? I'm always losin' it...<br />***<br /><br />Thanks for reading, kids!
