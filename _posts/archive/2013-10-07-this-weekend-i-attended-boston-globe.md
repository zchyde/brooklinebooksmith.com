This weekend, I attended the Boston Globe-Horn Book Awards and the Horn Book at Simmons Colloquium, which focuses on the books that were honored. Though a bit lesser-known than the Newbery and Caldecott Awards, the BGHBs are a high honor within the children's book community, and the winners often don't get enough attention. (Heck, these days even the Newbery and Caldecott don't make it onto the <i>Today</i>&nbsp;show.) This year's winners were all books we're enthusiastic about here, so I thought I'd give them some screen time.<br /><br />The Picture Book Winner:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a class="thickbox initThickbox-processed" href="http://images.indiebound.com/236/380/9780374380236.jpg" rel="field_image_cache_0" style="background-color: white; color: #4b5cc3; font-family: 'Helvetica neue', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; text-decoration: none;" title="Building Our House"><img src="http://images.booksense.com/images/books/236/380/FC9780374380236.JPG" style="border: 0px;" title="" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Building Our House</i>, by Jonathan Bean</td></tr></tbody></table>With spare text but very informative (and very '70s) illustrations, Jonathan Bean tells the story of how his family built their own house when they moved to the country. This one is a must for any budding engineer. Just ask Paul about how he and his family have embraced Bean's work; Bean's new book<i>, Big Snow, </i>"makes [his] heart sing!!"<br /><div><br /></div><div>The Fiction Winner:&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a class="thickbox initThickbox-processed" href="http://images.indiebound.com/579/012/9781250012579.jpg" rel="field_image_cache_0" style="background-color: white; color: #4b5cc3; font-family: 'Helvetica neue', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; text-decoration: none;" title="Eleanor &amp; Park"><img src="http://images.booksense.com/images/books/579/012/FC9781250012579.JPG" style="border: 0px;" title="" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eleanor and Park</i>, by Rainbow Rowell</td></tr></tbody></table>This young adult novel is romantic but not just about the romance. It has characters with big problems, but it isn't just about those problems. It's funny, sometimes even while it's heartbreaking. It takes place in the '80s, but you can get it without having experienced them. John Green loved it. What more do you need to know?<br /><div><br /></div><div>The Nonfiction Winner:</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a class="thickbox initThickbox-processed" href="http://images.indiebound.com/495/737/9780803737495.jpg" rel="field_image_cache_0" style="background-color: white; color: #4b5cc3; font-family: 'Helvetica neue', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; text-decoration: none;" title="Electric Ben: The Amazing Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin"><img src="http://images.booksense.com/images/books/495/737/FC9780803737495.JPG" style="border: 0px;" title="" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Electric Ben</i>, by Robert Byrd</td></tr></tbody></table>Don't be fooled by the thinness of this picture book biography. It's full of information, arranged for maximum grabability. Ben Franklin had personality, and by the end of the book, you'll feel like you're on a nickname basis with him.<br /><div><br /></div><div>There's variety in kids' and YA books, is what I'm saying. Particularly in <i>good</i>&nbsp;kids' and YA books.</div>
