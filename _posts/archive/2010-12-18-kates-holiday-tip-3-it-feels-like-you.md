Sigh.<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-family:courier new;"></span></strong><br /><strong><span style="font-family:courier new;">Imagine everyone today....as a deer.</span></strong><br /><br />So- for whatever reason, when I am in large crowds, I start to imagine everyone as deer. I imagine them as the deer version of themselves...skinny jeans, glasses, baby bjorns, spandex, converse.....whatever they are wearing, they <em>continue</em> to wear, but as deer...deer with purses, messenger bags and helmets, deers with bags of gifts, and 20oz of hot coffee...<br /><br />I have done this for as long as I can remember. When it happens- I find it soothing to think of people as my favorite spirit animal.<br /><br />So during this stressful and frantic final week before gifty Mc-Gorge town....remember you can cover everyone on your list in this one store...<em>for reals</em>...then ...take a moment to breathe, close your weary eyes....and imagine a deer in a plaid scarf blogging at a messy desk in the back of the bustling booksmith.<br /><br />Now, I'm gonna go get some free Taza chocolate from that pretty deer at the front.<br /><br />Oh deer.
