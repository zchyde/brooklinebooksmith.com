A Boston resident for over three years and a fan of--if not the fast food chain--that creamy mint green shake myself, I was ashamed to say I did not know. But I was able to tell him about Dunkin Donuts' seasonal Irish Creme donut, a sugar coated bun filled with a creme not-quite-green but a shade less yellow than your traditional Boston creme. It's nothing compared to their autumnal pumpkin donut, but as a novelty item, it's not a bad way to get yourself primed for St. Patrick's Day.</div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Of course, to get a true taste of Ireland, no one goes for the food. This month, we've got a range of Irish literature on display, writers who will give you a more accurate glimpse into Irish culture, landscape and cuisine--without the foul aftertaste of American fast food. We've got the classics:&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780684807317" href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780684807317">Yeats</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781408157305" href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781408157305">Beckett</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780679722762" href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780679722762">Joyce</a>, and Flann O'Brien's<a data-mce-href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781564781819" href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781564781819"><em>&nbsp;At Swim Two Birds</em></a>.

Kanigel introduces the reader to the lost world of the Great Blasket, an island off the west coast of Ireland, renowned for its former communal life and preservation of the Irish language.

Whether you're looking for a guidebook, map, or simply some good armchair travel, we've got them, no artificial flavors added.</div>
