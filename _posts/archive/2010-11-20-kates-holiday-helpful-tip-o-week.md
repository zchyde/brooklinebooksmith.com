There's food everywhere. Good food. Your pants are not yet elastic and so you must decide what to eat, and how much. This is one of life's pains.<br /><br />I think exploring our massive cookbook selection is a good way to focus intention on what you are eating. That way you won't be spending as much time as I do in the diet section of the store.<br /><br />This time of year is tough...but our Christmas/Hanukkah lights are up, and we've got the heat on and some good tunes. It's kinda like a mini vacation to walk the isles. (kinda)<br /><br />If things are tight this year, head down to our bargain basement...the new home for our Used, Sale and Remainder books.<br /><br />Treat yourself well this week. Be extra kind to everyone who crosses your path, because you never know if they are the great pumpkin or not.<br /><br />(I meant angel, yea....<em>angel</em>)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div></div>
