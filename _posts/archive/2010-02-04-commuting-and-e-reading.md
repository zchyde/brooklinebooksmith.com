I try to walk to work when I can, but sometimes it's too cold and I'm too lazy. Sometimes I just like to people watch...I like to see what everyone is reading. I'm on the green line so usually the people have a Brookline Booksmith boomark...which always cheers me up in the morning. <br /><br />I've seen a handful of people reading from the Kindle, or the Sony e-reader. I can never tell what they are reading, so they can hide their romance novels, but the downside is they can't show off that they are reading Joyce. <br /><br />Isn't there an unspoken romance in seeing that a stranger is reading a book you love? Isn't there that moment where you think there may be a psychic connection? Or maybe you look to see how far along they are, and guess what part they are at by their facial expressions?<br /><br />I think of what I would lose if I switched my library to the kindle...<br /><br /><br />-feeling comfortable taking a bath with a book<br />-taking the book to the beach<br />-leaving the book in the freezing cold, or scorching heat and knowing it will still work when I get to it<br />-dog- earring pages<br />-writing in the margins<br />-watching as the book blooms in thickness from handling<br />-the mosaic of fonts on my bookshelves<br /><strong>-my bookshelves</strong><br />-knowing no one can ever go into the book and take out the words for some copyright problem<br /><br /><br />What else would you miss?<br /><br />leave a comment or email me...this might make a cool t shirt. Check out our new black tote bags with the quote "books with pages since 1961" If I wasn't such a Luddite I'd post a picture...maybe one of my colleagues will... hint hint....
