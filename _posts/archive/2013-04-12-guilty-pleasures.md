The other day, one of our book buyers Mark and I were having an in-depth conversation about music. "What music do you listen to that is a guilty pleasure?" I honestly couldn't think of anything. Akin to books, I fully believe that if you like something, you like it, and why worry about what others will think. Just like other traits we can't always pick what lights up our brain's pleasure centers, and if it doesn't hurt anybody then WHO CARES. Embrace what you like! Listen to Sublime and read trashy romances!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PUEIupM9xC4/UVcEf4ZpVdI/AAAAAAAABOY/wE-COoqLh0I/s1600/vikings.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="275" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PUEIupM9xC4/UVcEf4ZpVdI/AAAAAAAABOY/wE-COoqLh0I/s400/vikings.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>But Mark's question resurfaced for me this week when I started watching the new History Channel series <i>Vikings. Vikings</i>&nbsp;is an original series that follows characters based on legendary sagas and set around the time of the first Viking raids on England. There's a badass shieldmaiden lady warrior. There's music from <a href="http://www.wardruna.com/about/">Wardruna</a>, one of my favorite bands. There's handsome men with long hair (perhaps the Achilles heel of this bookseller). I can't stop looking at this show and it makes me feel a little ... guilty. The acting is good. The premise is cool. While occasionally historically inaccurate, the sets and ships and armor and weapons and clothes are cool. Gabriel Byrne is always good. The pacing and dialogue is a bit ... rough, but the show is young and could always improve.<br /><br />Anyway, it's definitely a guilty pleasure for me. If you're in the same longship here are some recent acquisitions to the UBC to read during the commercials so by the end of your hour you feel like you've done something productive.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nwFzQ_v_Lkc/UVcHTaQy1BI/AAAAAAAABOo/ZIqbhyZsHkM/s1600/vikinghoard.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nwFzQ_v_Lkc/UVcHTaQy1BI/AAAAAAAABOo/ZIqbhyZsHkM/s320/vikinghoard.jpg" width="242" /></a></div><i>Hounded </i>by Kevin Hearne. A series that melds all kinds of ancient mythology into a modern day fantasy adventure mystery quest. Thor makes an&nbsp;appearance&nbsp;eventually. The author also wins my award for best book dedication ever: "Look, Mom! I made this! Can we put it on the fridge?"<br /><br /><i>The Vikings</i> by Else Roesdahl. A quick and dirty history with lots of pictures.<br /><br /><i>The Kings in Winter</i> by Cecelia Holland. A historical fantasy novel of Celtic chieftains fighting off their Viking overlords. GOOD LUCK.<br /><br />Niall Ferguson's book on Vikings, as well as the Sagas are also obvious books you should have already read. Get off the internet and go read them now.<br /><br />Got any other guilty pleasures to share? Confess in the comments!
