I just recently went to see <em><a href="http://www.hairspraymovie.com/">Hairspray </a>--</em> the musical-based on a Broadway musical-based on a John Waters film -- and fell in love with it. It reminds me of the best parts of classic musicals--singing and dancing and costumes, yes, but also just the incredible joy of being alive (and a happy ending doesn't hurt). If you haven't seen it yet, go mama go, go, go! (If you have and you got the reference, good for you!)<br /><br />I actually grew up loving musicals. Near my house was an old-fashioned movie house called <a href="http://redfordtheatre.com/index2.htm">The Redford Theater</a>. It showed classics on the big screen with an organ performance and cartoon shorts before the show, an intermission when the organ played again(!), and a ceiling painted to look like the sky with little twinkling lights for stars.<br /><br />On their website you can actually see a <a href="http://redfordtheatre.com/filmdatabase/">film database </a>with the schedules from the 1970s through today, and if you want to know the movies that shaped me growing up, this is your best way to learn--just pick any year in the mid to late '80s. I was looking at the schedule for 1988, and I have no doubt that I was in the audience for <em>West Side Story</em> and <em>Meet Me In St. Louis</em> and <em>Showboat</em> and <em>Oklahoma</em>.<br /><br />So, the whole point of this exercise in nostalgia is to let you know how jazzed I am that Rough Guides has come out with a new book in their series of film guides: <strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781843536505">The Rough Guide to Film Musicals</a></em></strong> by David Parkinson. It is fan-freaking-tastic for both the beginner and old pro. I learned more about musicals I thought I already knew and am glad to have added some to my needs-to-be-seen list (<em>Love Me Tonight</em>, how have we never met?).<br /><br />Mr. Parkinson is very informed--this is not a piece of fluff, but neither is it overstuffed with film-school jargon. I also like that he is opinionated (except, of course, for when I disagree...) without being condescending towards the films or his readers.<br /><br />I should note that this is part of a great series that Rough Guides does on film. I'm quite familiar with <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781843537106"><em><strong>The Rough Guide to Chick Flicks</strong></em> </a>by Sam Cook, but there are also books on <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781843536024">American Independent Film</a>, <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;initiate=yes&amp;ks=q&amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;title=&amp;author=&amp;qstext=rough+film+noir">Film Noir</a>, <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781843536499">Westerns</a>, and others. I'm of the opinion that they are way better than most of the film guides out there.<br /><br />Speaking of musicals, the store is quite quiet for a Friday night during the summer. Me thinks it is all the kids at home watching High School Musical 2. Darn it, why aren't I?
