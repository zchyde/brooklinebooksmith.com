For many Brookliners, the smell of turkey in the air, whether it be November or December, means a lot of travel.&nbsp; When I was six, I never understood why I couldn't take puzzles with me.&nbsp; Of course I wouldn't loose the pieces...but there was also the issue of the box.&nbsp; It's a standard, puzzles come in boxes.&nbsp; It is also a fact that if you&nbsp;place a box with a lot of small pieces in it, it&nbsp;will result in a very squished and ripped up&nbsp;box.&nbsp; All in all, not good.&nbsp; That is why some of our bestselling kids' puzzles are very intriguing.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Well, to begin with they come in a resealable bag.&nbsp; And they measure 8x12, which is a little smaller than the size of most airline and train fold-out-trays.&nbsp; Introducing Travel Pouch Puzzles, that come in a variety of designs -- dragons, ballet, space, USA, world, horses, pirates, ocean, and more!<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7SIAzrEtyvc/Ts2FvCP7oXI/AAAAAAAAASI/4g2Opkywz38/s1600/travel%252520puzzles.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7SIAzrEtyvc/Ts2FvCP7oXI/AAAAAAAAASI/4g2Opkywz38/s320/travel%252520puzzles.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />And if you are still reading, I'll let you in on a secret.&nbsp; Our selection of these Travel&nbsp;Pouch Puzzles will be 15% off Thursday,&nbsp;December 1st only, AFTER our First Annual Staff Recommendations at 7:00 pm, downstairs&nbsp;in our Readers and Writers space.&nbsp; (Staff Recommendations for grown-ups will take place on Wednesday, November 30 at 7:00 pm.)&nbsp; What other new&nbsp;and&nbsp;recent&nbsp;titles and gifts of the year&nbsp;will we be recommending (all at 15% off)?&nbsp; You'll have to come and find out.&nbsp; <br /><br />You won't want to miss this event!&nbsp; Come join us for an inspiring evening of refreshments, wine, and literary discussion to discover the perfect gift or select your next winter read.&nbsp; Complimentary wrap will also be available.
