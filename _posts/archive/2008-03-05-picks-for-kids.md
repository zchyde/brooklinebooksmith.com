Yay! <div><br /><div>My first recommendation is <strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780316057776">The Mysterious Benedict Society</a></em></strong> by Trenton Lee Stewart. My blurb: Four very clever children—Reynie, Kate, Sticky, and Constance—come together under the tutelage of the curious Mr. Benedict to form the Mysterious Benedict Society. I loved trying to solve the puzzles and challenges presented to the children as they took their qualifying exams and then moved on to their mission—saving the world from the evil Mr. Curtain! This is a true treat of a novel that is equally fun for both kids and adults.</div><br /><div>By the way, <a href="http://www.hachettebookgroupusa.com/features/MysteriousBenedict/content/index.asp">this is a really cool website </a>that tells you more about the book and lets you test yourself with the types of puzzles and challenges that the Mysterious Benedict Society faced (and, if you're like me, find out you're not nearly as clever as Reynie, Kate, Sticky or Constance!). </div><br /><div>I was thrilled to find out that a sequel will be coming out in May--<strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780316057806">The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Perilous Journey</a></em></strong>. My Hachette rep got me an advance copy and I couldn't put it down! Just as good as the first. Yippee!</div><br /><br /><div></div></div>
