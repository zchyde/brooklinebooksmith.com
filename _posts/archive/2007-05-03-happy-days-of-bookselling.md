Here are some of the things that happened Wednesday that made it a great day to be a bookseller:

1\. I was able to tell a man buying a copy of [_The Secret Life of Lobsters_](http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9780060555597) that Trevor <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Corson</span> has a new book coming out _and_ that we were having an event with him! I wrote down the book’s name (_[Zen of Fish](http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&initiate=yes&ks=q&qsselect=KQ&title=&author=&qstext=zen+of+fish)_) and the date of our reading ([June 14<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">th</span>](http://brooklinebooksmith.com/Events/MainEvent.html)) and sent him out the door with a smile.

2\. It happened twice in one day! I was able to tell a man buying a used copy of Pete Hamill’s _[Forever](http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9780316735698)_ that his new book (_[North River](http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9780316340588)_) is coming out in June. I always feel good when I can give people information they <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">didn</span>’t even know they wanted. Hopefully it makes them happy and lets them know I care about what I do. It makes me happy to think I might actually know a little bit about what I'm doing in this world.

3\. When I'm out on the floor, I should let you know, I am a total snoop. I generally always have an ear out for someone talking about a book whose title they couldn't remember or wondering where we might keep a certain book. I'd like to think I'm subtle when I shimmy over and say "I'm sorry to interrupt, but can I help you?" Well, in this case, I overheard two women talking about a book they had read about but didn't see on the shelf. I knew the book--_[How to Talk to a Widower](http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9780385338905)_--because I had a galley of it right on my desk, and I also knew that it wouldn't be out until July. Bookseller <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">extraordinaire</span> Jess was dispatched downstairs and found the book <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">amongst</span> the forest of galleys on my desk. They got my galley and I got a big smile from them. There was a moment of pain as I hadn't gotten to read it yet, but I remind myself that I have plenty of others to choose from and at least I know this one will be read. But I hope they come back and tell me if they liked it.

4\. I had to tell someone the book they were looking for was out of print. But maybe we had it used downstairs? We did! Yes!

And last but not least…
5\. A customer told me I had great hair.
