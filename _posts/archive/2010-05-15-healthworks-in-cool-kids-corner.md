The wealthy-women-only gym maybe taking over the space occupied by our long standing and victoriously defeated foe, Barnes and Noble?</div><br /><div></div><br /><div>I'm feeling such a strange mix of emotions. Currently I have an underutilized "student" membership at the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Healthworks</span> across from BU. I moved, and traveling there truly sucks, but if the rumors are real and I could workout before or after work right here in Coolidge Corner, well....let's just say there would be no fear of bathing me with a stick on a rag...</div><br /><div></div><br /><div>What would that experience be like? Working out next to customers? If you know me , you know that I am very into sustainable community living, and the shop indie/local ideals...but I do have boundaries.</div><br /><div></div><br /><div>I've been working in Coolidge Corner for 6 years, and my customers still do a double-take when they see me out of context. For example...sometimes when I am shopping at <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">CVS</span>, or grabbing a coffee I'll run into a customer who I can tell is struggling to place me....and usually they think I work wherever it is we happen to be standing...I have even fitted some folks for bras at Lady Grace even though I do not , nor have I ever worked there...because service workers all kinda look the same...and I don't like to <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">disappoint</span>......(i kid) my point is....</div><br /><div></div><br /><div>If I'm at the gym, will you be asking me for advice on proper free-weight techniques? (I could actual give it but still) And will I want to see my community lounging in the sauna?</div><br /><div></div><br /><div>This begs the question....how much is too much community? Privacy and convenience are at odds here, and this <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Healthworks</span> possibility is really giving me some anxiety. I'd love to know your thoughts. How much living should you do near your job? How close am I to living in a commune?</div><br /><div></div><br /><div>Will you make fun of me if I slip during step-aerobics?</div><br /><div></div><br /><div></div><br /><div></div><br /><div></div>
