I do not believe this horse bites. I think the owner would prefer drunk "pub-crawl" attendees not commune with Sheila (or whatever the horses name is.)<br /><br />Either way I stood there, this past Saturday (in what felt like spring) and photographed the horse.<br />I was a bit tired from roaming the aquarium, that when I noticed a drunk broseph stumble over to my subject....<br /><br /><div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ha51nVO5M2Y/TX5qc5LVzhI/AAAAAAAAANg/IK0k_GX2FTA/s1600/aqua21.bmp"><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 477px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 322px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5584017632603262482" border="0" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ha51nVO5M2Y/TX5qc5LVzhI/AAAAAAAAANg/IK0k_GX2FTA/s400/aqua21.bmp" /></a> <img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 456px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 301px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5584018263539380274" border="0" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GaqeB4KPegY/TX5rBnmO8DI/AAAAAAAAANw/qdpHuinct00/s400/aqua23.bmp" /> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div>I didn't warn him about the sign on Sheila. I think part of me wanted to see if the written warning was truthful. Then I heard myself think that, and said (to myself) <em>did you kinda want to see Sheila bite Logan </em>(or whatever his name is)?</div><div> </div><div>I love people watching, and reading especially good narrative poetry brings me closer to a humanity that I'm often distanced from. </div><div> </div><div>On the trip home, I didn't have anyone sitting in front of me to creepily watch. That's where having a collection of kick-ass poetry comes in. The good stuff is better than hoping a horse bites a stranger.</div><div><br /><div><br /><div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hFF7494ovCY/TX5qCLpmf7I/AAAAAAAAANY/_ptdF6nb0qY/s1600/a.bmp"><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 400px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5584017173705555890" border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hFF7494ovCY/TX5qCLpmf7I/AAAAAAAAANY/_ptdF6nb0qY/s400/a.bmp" /></a> <br />Come in and check out our selections of new poetry. There's some filthy-brilliant-sick-funny stuff here. There's tons of staff recommendations to help guide you to the perfect collection...just in time for poetry month! (Or did I miss that?) Either way...It's more entertaining, and makes you look less crazy than say....taking photos of empty seats.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div></div></div></div></div>
