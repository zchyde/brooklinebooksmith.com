Mark just popped in to tell me that <i>Simple Dreams</i>&nbsp;by Linda Ronstadt is our top seller this week, which may blow your minds as the book isn't even out yet. &nbsp;We've been taking preorders all week, filling out author signing request forms and taking people's addresses. &nbsp;We've fielded calls, processed Internet orders, all of that good stuff so that people everywhere can get signed copies or tickets to her event. &nbsp;Everyone on staff under the age of 40 has seen the video below&nbsp;and should know how to pronounce Tucson (<i>TOO-sahn</i>)&nbsp;so I know we're ready.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/OMy8GzeHBGk/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="http://youtube.googleapis.com/v/OMy8GzeHBGk&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://youtube.googleapis.com/v/OMy8GzeHBGk&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div><br />I'll stop dancing and tell you the point of this post: we can get books signed for you. &nbsp;When you see an author on our event calendar and can't make the event, pre-order it by phone, <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/linda-ronstadt-simple-dreams" target="_blank">Internet</a>, or in person and we can get it signed for you. &nbsp;Are you in California? No problem. &nbsp;We'll ship it. &nbsp;Are you in Turkey? &nbsp;No problem. &nbsp;We'll ship it. &nbsp;Let us know and we'll get it done, however many copies you want.
