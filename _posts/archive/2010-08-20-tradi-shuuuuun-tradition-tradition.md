When I started working here there were certain closers (night shift managers) who would have everyone collaborate and come up with five or so words, chosen at random or because of trickiness in their meaning or usage, which had to be worked into the closing announcements which we broadcast over the intercom fifteen minutes before closing.   Everyone had their own way about it, but my favorite was when Kyle had to take up the challenge.  <br /><br />Kyle, when he finally left the store, struck out for Plymouth Plantation, where he donned a Pilgrim hat and grew out his beard, all the more authentic for being just a scraggly, patchy cloud under his chin.  He was born to be a Pilgrim, I don't think he would mind me saying that.  After his first season, he stayed on after the Plantation closed to visitors for the winter in order to spend a month making charcoal in the traditional, laborious way. <br /><br />Kyle picks up the phone, hits the intercom button, and breathes in and out, collecting his thoughts.  He quietly clears his throat and says something like "For many years, people, well, laypeople, I should say, have put a good deal less than what one might call rigorous thought into the subject of baleen, which is the flexible filtering structure found in the mouths of certain species of whales." <br />And he goes on, in excess of five or more minutes, to describe the various uses of baleen, such as whips, corsets, and finally, tools to crease paper.  And so to books, and to this bookstore, and to the fact that the door will be locked in a moment or two.<br /><br />I loved that.<br /><br />I've been here a long time, and I often do miss the old days.<br /><br />If you have one, tell me a good Booksmith memory.
