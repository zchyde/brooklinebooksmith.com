We're taking a Westward Expansion into the Events area (hi Jamie!) and filling up large cases with amazing and wonderful books. Our Kids section is now expanding to two cases, and Cookbooks will move making more room for New Arrivals, and our Book Club picks are expanding to include Staff Recommends in the UBC. This all means that we have more room to grow as far as kids books are concerned, so if you have some good children's picture books in nice shape, bring them in during our buying hours: Wednesday through Saturday, 10 AM - 4 PM.<br /><br />Big Big Big Changes come check em out and load up on books to read outside in this lovely weather!
