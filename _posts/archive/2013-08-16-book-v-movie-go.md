Given that there have been, in history, at least two examples of really great movie adaptations of books that are equal in awesomeness (IMHO) than I think it can be done, and if an adaptation is poorly done, let's just blame the test market. Or whatever.<br /><br />So. Books that are just as good as the movies. For me, number 1 forever and always is <i>Room With a View</i>&nbsp;- the Merchant &amp; Ivory is just as good as Forster's classic, I don't care if it's heresy, there I said it.<br /><br />Furthermore, <i>Cold Comfort Farm</i>. The version with a baby Kate Beckinsale totally captures the spirit, charm and one-liners of Stella Gibbons classic satire, and every time I watch it I want to read the book again, and conversely every time I read the book I want to watch the movie.<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3fdEF21GK2k/Ug0q2HfTJNI/AAAAAAAABXo/UAGYRl9qUOk/s1600/tess.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="129" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3fdEF21GK2k/Ug0q2HfTJNI/AAAAAAAABXo/UAGYRl9qUOk/s200/tess.jpg" width="200" /></a>There are a couple recent Masterpiece Theatre adaptations that I felt were as good as the books, the latest <u><i>Jane Eyre</i></u> with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens (I cry at the engagement scene every time I watch it, just as when I read it SNIFF), <i>North and South</i> with Richard Armitage (grrr) and Hardy's <i>Tess </i>with Gemma Arterton is GENIUS casting, because there's something about Arterton's totally sweet and trusting doe-eyed face that reminds you throughout the film, just as Hardy reminds you throughout the novel, that Tess is the sweetest, most innocent milkmaid with the worst luck. Ultimate heart breaker!<br /><br />How about you? Any adaptations that you enjoy as much as the book? Or possibly MORE than the book? Tell me in the comments!
