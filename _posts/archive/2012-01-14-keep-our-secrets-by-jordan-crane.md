This is an emergency blogpost by Zoe and Katrina! Do not attempt to adjust your television! Last night we were closing and discovered this book on the gift books table:

﻿At first, I this was a slightly bizarre but interesting board book, but upon further inspection, I discovered that the point of the book is to heat up the black areas of the book with your hands or, more effectively, a hair dryer.

Even the cover is magical.

I was blown away. This book is amazing. Straight up wizardry. Come in, check it out! This has been an Emergency Blogpost by Zoe and Katrina! You may new resume regularly scheduled programming
