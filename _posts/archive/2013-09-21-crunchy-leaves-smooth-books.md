All the best books are coming out, the weather is perfect for warm tea or pumpkin spice lattes while you curl up in a cozy blanket and read all the books, or curl up in a nice scarf and fend off the chubby squirrels preparing for winter in the Common. There are tons of great books the store is jazzed about released this fall: Jumpa Lahiri's <i>Lowland</i>, I've already started tucking into Anya von Bremzen's <i>Mastering the Art of Soviet Cooking</i>&nbsp;and the new David Wiesener book <i>Mr. Wuffles</i> are just the tip of the autumnal iceberg.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PEZOBsPo3VA/Uj24qg39ZCI/AAAAAAAABZU/6yYbx9KEnNU/s1600/John_Quidor_-_Headless_Horseman_Pursuing_Ichabod_Crane_-_Smithsonian.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="157" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PEZOBsPo3VA/Uj24qg39ZCI/AAAAAAAABZU/6yYbx9KEnNU/s200/John_Quidor_-_Headless_Horseman_Pursuing_Ichabod_Crane_-_Smithsonian.jpg" width="200" /></a></div>In addition to all the new fall books, the UBC has <strike>cured </strike>curated a fine selection of <strike>meats</strike>&nbsp;books that are perfect for autumn: Ivy League campuses going back to school, spooky New England ghost stories, young couples falling into piles of leaves, the whole gamut of super-satisfying fall time reads! We've got a nice new case at the top of the stairs, for the discerning book lover on the go who might not have the time to get lost in our subterranean bookshelves. The selection changes daily so come quickly and come often! And if there's a special book you love to reread every fall, let me know in the comments!<br /><br /><br />
