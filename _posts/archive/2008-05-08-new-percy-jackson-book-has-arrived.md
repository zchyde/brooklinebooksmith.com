Yippee! I wanted to grab one right out of the box on Tuesday morning and start reading but restrained myself. Instead I took home <em><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781423101482">Titan's Curse</a></em>, the third book, to reread before I start on book four (in true good-book fashion, I missed my T stop last night as a result). I leave for Florida later tonight which gives me three hours of uninterrupted time with Percy, Annabeth and Grover! Yay! </div><br /><div></div><br /><div>I'm also taking <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780307269751"><em><strong>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</strong></em> </a>by Stieg Larsson as Alie just finished it and cannot stop talking about how amazing it is. And I mean that quite literally. There's a window (well, not really a window, more of a square-shaped hole in the wall) between our offices and I've heard her rave about this book pretty much multiple times a day to anyone and everyone. How can I not try it? </div>
