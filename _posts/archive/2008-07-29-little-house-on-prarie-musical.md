My friend Elly <em>loved </em>L.M. Montgomery and all her Anne books. I remember our arguments over which books were better, which while not quite of the my-dad-can-beat-up-your-dad variety were pretty close.<br /><div></div><br /><div><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780553213133"><strong><em>Anne of Green Gables</em></strong> </a>turns 100 this year and has been getting a lot of <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/147758">media attention </a>as a result. Much to my immature delight, however, there was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/28/theater/28prai.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ref=theater">an article </a>in yesterday's <em>New York Times</em> about a new musical version of <a href="http://www.guthrietheater.org/prairie"><em>Little House on the Prairie</em> </a>opening at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. Ha! Take that Anne! </div>
