The Holidays are over, and slowly, we sink into the wintry abyss, crouching over clipboards as we correct our inventory and surfacing only occasionally to greet the odd snow-booted customer whose best friend has a January birthday.<br /><br />Not.<br /><br />For one thing, though January is traditionally a quieter month, the store's been pretty busy. You people are die-hards, and we love you. A lot of you are using gift cards you got over the holidays, and helping kids shop for themselves may spoil the guessing game of gift-giving, but it makes up for it with lots of great conversations.<br /><br />For another, January and February are actually pretty eventful months. We spent about two seconds wondering what we would do with the space freed up by the Christmas and Hanukkah books before we answered ourselves: Martin Luther King Day, Presidents' Day, African-American History Month, Valentine's Day, Groundhog Day, plain old winter books, and the top 25 from 2012. And once they're announced on January 28th, winners of the Caldecott, Newbery, and other American Library Association awards. And probably some stuff I'm forgetting, because there's a lot of stuff.<br /><br />January is also going to include some new ventures. On Monday, January 14 at 5pm, we'll hold our first <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/event/young-adult-book-club-jan-2013">YA Book Club</a>&nbsp;for teens ages 12-18. The first meeting will focus on the works of John Green; be there if you think it's even a little adorable that a young customer asked me this week, "Are you by any chance a Nerdfighter?" (There was context, I swear.) The YA Book Club will meet on the second Monday of every month unless otherwise noted.<br /><br />Not quite ready for books with words like "abundance" in the title? Perhaps our new (or revived) <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/storytime-jan2013">Children's Story Time</a> is for you. Members of our children's team will read picture books aloud on the third Saturday of every month, starting on January 19 at 10:30 am.<br /><br />December, you know you're jealous.<br /><br /><br />
