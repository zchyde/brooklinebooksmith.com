The holidays have already started here. &nbsp;Try as we might, Christmas items are creeping up everywhere. &nbsp;I just realized I accidentally put on red and green today, which makes me want to cry a bit. &nbsp;Thanksgiving hasn't been ignored--we valiantly have an inflatable turkey up front along with other Thanksgiving items (have you seen the <a href="http://instagram.com/p/RqY1gwylhC/" target="_blank">turkey mask</a>?)--but Christmas is still elbowing its way forward. I'm trying to stop it like that person who likes standing in the middle of doorways, but am infinitely less successful.<div><br /></div><div>Before I go on my Thanksgiving leave, here are some shout outs. &nbsp;To the people who were in Trader Joe's this afternoon, aren't you glad we survived the line and have all these bottles of wine? I sure am. &nbsp;To the customer who just called to ask if we are participating in <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/Shop-Small/" target="_blank">Small Business Saturday</a>, we are, and thank you for being so enthusiastic on the phone. &nbsp;To the hot guy in fiction, thank you for being handsome and yes, you may have my phone number. &nbsp;To the woman who loved <a href="http://brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/natasha" target="_blank">Natasha</a>'s recommendation of Jeffrey Eugenides, thank you for being so fun.&nbsp;To you, blog reader, thanks for taking the time to read this. &nbsp;You're a sweetheart.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Happy Thanksgiving, everyone, and wish me luck with the turkey.</div>
