I shook my head and ignored it when I saw pumpkin beers infiltrating the market, and on my birthday a week ago when I had to bring a sweater, but the death knell came this week when two important things happened:<br /><br />1) My craving for a pumpkin smoothie won out at the end of a long shift, and<br />2) When I got a hankering to read Virginia Woolf.<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xTDjHGxK8gQ/UFn6FKBaD5I/AAAAAAAAA1U/PicjzTLN7aE/s1600/175px-ToTheLighthouse.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xTDjHGxK8gQ/UFn6FKBaD5I/AAAAAAAAA1U/PicjzTLN7aE/s200/175px-ToTheLighthouse.jpg" width="130" /></a>Typically, <i>Orlando </i>is my favorite, and reading Woolf in autumn started with <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>, but this year I was thinking of that scene with the deer head and the veil when I saw about the 800th horned-animal accessory (so hot right now) in a row. Sometimes, kids, you just have to surrender to what the universe is telling you to read. I just finally got caught up on <i>Mad Men</i>, and some lines that stuck with me might be subconsciously pushing me to pay attention to Lily Briscoe this time around. Who knows?!<br /><br />Other Booksmithereens have similar seasonal traditions. Bonnie in the C&amp;G reads Raymond Carver as the trees die. And other friends, my bestie Katia for one, reads Oscar Wilde.<br /><br />How about you? Any big autumnal reading plans? If not, stop by and get inspired! Or if you're soured on reading, get inspired by <a href="http://www.bookdust.com/">Robert The's super-cool book sculptures</a>, then come in and buy cheap $1 to hack up. Autumn is the perfect, contemplative weather for crafting beside a cup of tea.
