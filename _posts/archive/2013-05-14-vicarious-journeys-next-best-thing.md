It's not that I resent the well-deserved vacation she's taking from teaching art to Kindergarten through 6th graders, but I AM &nbsp;jealous. I've &nbsp;added her trip to the growing list of the many coveted, vicarious journeys I will be making through my friends this summer. Sometimes it can feel like everyone is leaving the country except me. Whenever I start to feel like this--just a little too home-bound--I know it's time to turn to the next best thing: the bookshelf.</div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">To my sister I recommended Orhan Pamuk's&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781400033881" href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781400033881"><em>Istanbul</em></a>. To the rest of you, I'm going to recommend armchair reading from our destination of the month shelf. And this month, we're featuring Spain. I happen to have two friends there right now. While they're traveling through Barcelona, I can read Carlos Luis Zafon's&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780143034902" href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780143034902"><em>Shadow of the Wind</em></a>, a mystery set in post-war Barcelona. Zafon's most recent work,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062206299" href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062206299"><em>Prisoner of Heaven</em></a>, also set in Barcelona, was just released in paperback. Or I could pick up George Orwell's classic<em><a data-mce-href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780156421171" href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780156421171">&nbsp;Homage to Catalonia</a>,&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;Colm Toibin's&nbsp;<em>Homage to Barcelona</em>, which happens to be available for a limited time as a sale book on our remainder tables at Booksmith!</div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><br /><a data-mce-href="https://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/FC9781566563680.jpg" href="https://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/FC9781566563680.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-9120" data-mce-src="https://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/FC9781566563680.jpg" height="140" src="https://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/FC9781566563680.jpg" style="border: 0px; cursor: default; float: right;" title="FC9781566563680" width="92" /></a></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Aside from novels set in the country we've got books that will help you delve into the Spain's culture, past and present, books like Elizabeth Nash's&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781566563680" href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781566563680"><em>Madrid: A Cultural History</em></a>&nbsp;and Giles Tremlett's&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780802716743" href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780802716743"><em>Ghosts of Spain</em></a>. As Madrid correspondents for&nbsp;<em>The Independent</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Guardian</em>, respectively, Nash and Tremlett share their extensive knowledge of the country, taking their readers deep into the roots of the culture, arts, and politics of Spain. Tremlett in particular explores some of the country's scars, opening up a conversation about Spain's unexplored past.</div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><a data-mce-href="https://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/97829158076771.jpg" href="https://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/97829158076771.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-9103" data-mce-src="https://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/97829158076771.jpg" height="217" src="https://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/97829158076771.jpg" style="border: 0px; cursor: default; float: left;" title="9782915807677" width="120" /></a>Speaking of the ghosts of Spain, to see a few for yourself, swing by San Jose Cathedral in Madrid, a favorite spot for ghost hunters in the city, according &nbsp;legend and to our&nbsp;<em>Secret Madrid</em>&nbsp;guide.
