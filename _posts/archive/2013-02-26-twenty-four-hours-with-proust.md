So when we inadvertently befriended a bored security guard, we asked. Unfortunately, neither of us spoke much French. But the guard seemed to understand, became animated, and sent us off down a long hallway with directions to turn at the end. We eagerly complied, only to end up at an exhibit of Louis the Something’s Globes.</div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Proust’s coveted hand-written drafts of his 3,000 page novel,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/%5Bmodel%5D-340" href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/%5Bmodel%5D-340"><em>In Search of Lost Time</em></a>, have<a data-mce-href="https://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/250px-MS_A_la_recherche_du_temps_perdu.jpg" href="https://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/250px-MS_A_la_recherche_du_temps_perdu.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-8876" data-mce-src="https://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/250px-MS_A_la_recherche_du_temps_perdu.jpg" height="164" src="https://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/250px-MS_A_la_recherche_du_temps_perdu.jpg" style="border: 0px; cursor: default; float: right;" title="250px-MS_A_la_recherche_du_temps_perdu" width="250" /></a>&nbsp;never been on display outside of Paris.

And they decided to hold this event last Tuesday, February 19, in other words: on my 30<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;birthday. As could think of no better way to celebrate, reflect on, and downright ponder the passing of time, I decided to go.</div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I spent the afternoon at the Morgan with Proust. At least, that was what it felt like, as I enclosed myself in the small, cubicle exhibit and poured over his manuscripts. Never mind that his handwriting was illegible and that, while my French has improved somewhat since my miscommunication with the library guard, my continuing education French classes haven’t quite got me up to the speed of, well, Proust’s vocabulary. I remembered that Proust translated his favorite author, Ruskin, without learning English, and I stared at those pages until I began to recognize the passages I had committed to heart.</div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><a data-mce-href="https://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/FC9781590515662.jpg" href="https://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/FC9781590515662.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-8871" data-mce-src="https://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/FC9781590515662.jpg" height="140" src="https://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/FC9781590515662.jpg" style="border: 0px; float: right;" title="FC9781590515662" width="95" /></a>On the opening page to&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/%5Bmodel%5D-340" href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/%5Bmodel%5D-340"><em>Swann’s Way</em></a>, Proust had drawn a bold line through an entire first paragraph. Then, near the bottom, he had penciled in a line so tenuous and faint it was difficult to discern: “<em>Longtemps, je me suis couche de bonne heure</em>.” In another draft on display the famous madeleine was referred to as a “biscotte”—it originally had its source in a commonplace slice of toast. This toast to madeleine transubstantiation will forever stand in my mind as the quintessential transformation of life into art.</div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><a data-mce-href="https://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_8346.jpg" href="https://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_8346.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8858" data-mce-src="https://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_8346-300x225.jpg" height="225" src="https://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_8346-300x225.jpg" style="border: 0px; float: left;" title="IMG_8346" width="300" /></a></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Sufficiently immersed in Proust, I dropped my bags at The Jane Hotel and headed up 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Ave to&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://www.192books.com/" href="https://www.192books.com/">192 Books</a>.&nbsp;The small, one-room&nbsp;carefully curated bookshop was cozily packed with people crowded around a small table where Adam Gopnik and Anka Muhlstein would introduce the 24-hour reading. Champagne was poured and&nbsp;madeleines nibbled as we listened to Gopnik read an exchange of letters between Proust and André Gide, who declined to publish Proust.

I felt privileged to be among them as I took my turn at the mike. And while I did not make it through the entire 24 hours, I did stay long enough to hear the madeleine dipped into tea, and of how its taste conjured up a past believed to be lost, the narrator’s panacea, and one for us all, against the forward turning of the years.</div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I thought that was the end of my Proustian pilgrimage to New York City, but I was wrong.
