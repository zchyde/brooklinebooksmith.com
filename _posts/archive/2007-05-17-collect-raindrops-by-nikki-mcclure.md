Today our copies of <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search;jsessionid=abcvQ5MXbrgtJdXmSvBkr"><em>Collect Raindrops</em> </a>have arrived! Ms. McClure creates intricate papercuts; her palatte is only black, white, and a single accent color. Her subjects are the natural world and us in it, and each image is accompanied by a directive--strengthen, swim with a friend, seek, respond, encourage. "Realize true riches" accompanies the image of someone picking tomatoes; the cover image is paired with the word "strengthen." This is art made for reflection, that makes you think but is not opposed to emotion as well.
