This past week I stumbled over an interview with Bill Cosby on the Today Show.  There were a lot of points of conversation in this video, but what I found interesting was Cosby's words of wisdom on reading.  Cosby has always been a wonderful advocate on reading and for kids being kids, but his words will never grow old.  Check it out.<br /><br />But first, an old clip [btw, just substitute "Western Michigan" for "Boston"]:<br /><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/h6BAVGa9JEE?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/h6BAVGa9JEE?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />Anyways, on the Today Show, the interview went from his death rumors to kids today.  With so much technology in the world and overwhelming situations, what's a parent to to do?  According to Cosby, "You say, look, you need to put this [the game] down for a little while.  They'll be plenty of time for that.  This is a thing that is called a book and we're going to read the book.  Because, I've found that children given the opportunity to be taught correct behavior -- good behavior -- and an education love reading books.  They LOVE it!"<br /><br />All in all, kids who read feel wonderful about themselves.  And, reading does not make victims, rather, it creates winners.<br /><br />Today Show clip:<br /><object width="420" height="245" id="msnbc7291ce" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=10,0,0,0"><param name="movie" value="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32545640" /><param name="FlashVars" value="launch=38674018&amp;width=420&amp;height=245"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="wmode" value="opaque" /><embed name="msnbc7291ce" src="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32545640" width="420" height="245" FlashVars="launch=38674018&amp;width=420&amp;height=245" allowscriptaccess="always" allowFullScreen="true" wmode="opaque" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="https://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash"></embed></object><p style="font-size:11px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #999; margin-top: 5px; background: transparent; text-align: center; width: 420px;">Visit msnbc.com for <a style="text-decoration:none !important; border-bottom: 1px dotted #999 !important; font-weight:normal !important; height: 13px; color:#5799DB !important;" href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com">breaking news</a>, <a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032507" style="text-decoration:none !important; border-bottom: 1px dotted #999 !important; font-weight:normal !important; height: 13px; color:#5799DB !important;">world news</a>, and <a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032072" style="text-decoration:none !important; border-bottom: 1px dotted #999 !important; font-weight:normal !important; height: 13px; color:#5799DB !important;">news about the economy</a></p>
