There seems to have been a rush this past week over&nbsp; fantastic new picturebooks arriving.&nbsp; Even though new books are a constant for most of the year, there is always those few that will catch your eye.&nbsp; Yeah...<br /><br /><em><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763641023">The Queen of France</a></em><br />by Tim Wadham<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m0BjfbCCxfg/TZO_lHan1EI/AAAAAAAAAPM/vfFyS1fwqWw/s1600/queen-of-france.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; cssfloat: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="181" r6="true" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m0BjfbCCxfg/TZO_lHan1EI/AAAAAAAAAPM/vfFyS1fwqWw/s200/queen-of-france.jpg" width="200" /></a></div>Does this illustration remind you of a certain grumpy bear?&nbsp; Well, that's because Kady MacDonald Denton also illustrated <em><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763641016">Bedtime for Bear</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763628079">Visitor for Bear!</a></em>&nbsp; When Rose wakes up, she's feeling a bit royal.&nbsp; Don't worry, she's not one of those <em>other</em> children who throw tantrums or fling demands when the crown goes on.&nbsp; She has quite the unique imagination, this little girl!&nbsp; When the Queen of France pricks her finger, she is off to find the Royal Physician -- found right after she visits her make-believe basket&nbsp;-- and continue on her way.&nbsp; This little inquisitive queen has a lot of fun when talking to the parents' of Rose.&nbsp; Yet, when she, the Queen of France, wants to&nbsp;trade places with Rose, what will happen?&nbsp; Who will her parents keep?<br /><br /><br /><em><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780811879545">Press Here </a></em><br />by Herve Tullet<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Mmb1l4fP4BU/TZO_qvjlsiI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/wgD9XHSerfA/s1600/41G-L%252BC0I3L__SL500_AA300_.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; cssfloat: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" r6="true" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Mmb1l4fP4BU/TZO_qvjlsiI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/wgD9XHSerfA/s200/41G-L%252BC0I3L__SL500_AA300_.jpg" width="200" /></a></div>Really, press the dots.&nbsp; And then again.&nbsp; Shake them, rub them, blow them away...&nbsp; You know, it's odd that nowhere in this book does it say "laugh," but that's the result whenever this book has been opened in our kids' reading area!<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><object style="height: 390px; width: 640px;"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/Kj81KC-Gm64?version=3"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/Kj81KC-Gm64?version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="640" height="390"></object><br /><br />(or press here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj81KC-Gm64">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj81KC-Gm64</a>)</span>
