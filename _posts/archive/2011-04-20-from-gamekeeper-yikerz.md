There are games that are classics, there are games that stay hidden in the box, and then there are games that are just that awesome.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, awesomeness is <em><a href="https://www.yikerzgame.com/yikerz_02_whatis.html">Yikerz!</a>&nbsp; </em><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DYH2PbUmbgM/Ta82cyD9e8I/AAAAAAAAAPg/7aaFV_BLL1w/s1600/71yZjccvZIL__AA1000_.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" i8="true" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DYH2PbUmbgM/Ta82cyD9e8I/AAAAAAAAAPg/7aaFV_BLL1w/s320/71yZjccvZIL__AA1000_.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />Place the magnets down one by one, but don't let them zap together.&nbsp; Even though they make a really cool sound, the object of the game is to get rid of all of your funky shaped magnets.&nbsp; I played a couple of rounds with the staff, and they had a great time with it.&nbsp; The beauty of this game is that there is a solitaire version -- beat your time to try to fit all of the magnets on the board without any zaps -- for when there is no one esle around.&nbsp; Or, you can also&nbsp;play with about 5 other&nbsp;players.&nbsp; The game manufacturer claims that this game is for 14 and up; however, I say age 8, as long as the child knows about magnet safety.<br /><br />Think of the fun that magnet geeks would have with this game!<br /><br />$14.99 and&nbsp;great for travel<br /><br />To watch a really fun demo, please visit here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4dlLOryWM4&amp;feature=player_detailpage">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4dlLOryWM4&amp;feature=player_detailpage</a>.
