on the eve of destruction<br />an old friend,<br /><br />a Believer<br /><br />quotes from the book<br />the passage upon which this whole hysteria hinges,<br /><br />and he can see what they mean,<br />but it's not really the point.<br /><br />he tells me that what it's all done is prompt him to examine his faith,<br />examine his self,<br />and measure his behavior against his ideals.<br /><br />that's good,<br />I know.<br />for him.<br /><br />for me,<br />one to whom gods are stories and faith is never enough,<br />all I can think is that I look forward to Sunday,<br />and Vermont woods and water,<br />and muddy kid feet<br />and no bookselling for a week,<br />because at least I know the trees will stay on earth with me,<br />and the water won't rise.<br /><br />but what I find most interesting is that Hamilton and Hincapie,<br />his partners of yore,<br />waited until the day before<br />the end of the world<br />to tell the world<br />that the great Lance Armstrong is a cheat.<br /><br />Me, I don't believe it,<br />what would be the point?<br />The Grand Tour will still cause the rise of some and the torture of many,<br />whether their hearts are pure or tainted.
