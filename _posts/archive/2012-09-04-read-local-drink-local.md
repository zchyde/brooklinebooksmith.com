Porter Square Books is launching a "Drink Local, Read Local" events series, pairing local beer tastings with book events about...well...beer. So awesome! Look for more info at their blog, portersquarebooksblog.blogspot.com, and <a href="https://portersquarebooksblog.blogspot.com/2012/08/read-local-drink-local-event-series.html" target="_blank">here </a>is the event post in question.<br /><br />When it comes to book sellin', its one for all and all for one.
