Hanukah, Chanukkah, and everything in between begins the night of December 20th. Looking for a book to help explain all the candle-counting and potato-frying to the young people in your life? Your holiday wish is our command.<br /><br />A standout this year is <i>Chanukah Lights</i>, with popups by King of Popup Robert Sabuda and text by poet-even-when-he-writes-prose Michael Rosen. Each of the eight nights gets a winter-white popup spread and a sentence or two about the holiday's significance.<br /><br />Little hands not quite ready for delicate three-dimensional paper art? Priddy's Bright Baby Touch and Feel has the perfect offering. <i>Hanukkah</i> introduces one word per page with tactile illustrations. Warning: 3D frosting may cause cookie cravings.<br /><br />Slightly older readers may enjoy bopping to the beat of Erica Silverman's <i>The Hanukkah Hop!</i> And anyone who likes good stories and likes getting mail should enjoy the Send-a-Story edition of Naomi Howland's <i>Latkes, Latkes, Good to Eat</i>. If you've read Tomie dePaola's <i>Strega Nona</i>, you'll recognize elements of the abundantly delicious plot (and if you haven't read <i>Strega Nona</i>, I know what's going on your gift list this year).<br /><br />We've got coloring books. We've got activity books. We've got candles and gelt, and we're full of gift advice. Come on in!
