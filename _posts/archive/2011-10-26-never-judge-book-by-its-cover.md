Even so, I find myself looking over titles and thinking <em>okay that title or cover is just weird,</em> despite the fact that the book still has the opportunity to be brilliant (and then there are the duds&nbsp;of which the&nbsp;cover is already too much to look at).  Sometimes titles are misleading -- or maybe misleading in the adult's eyes.  </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780064431972">The Hating Book</a></em> was one of the most checked out books in my elementary school library, and probably one that received&nbsp;countless eye rolls.  Yes, the major theme in the book is&nbsp;<strike> hate </strike>&nbsp;a strong dislike, but it does not hold to the last page.  </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>There are two best friend, see, who aren't talking with each other, "When I went to walk home with her, she had already gone" and "when she took her dog out and&nbsp;I whistled to him, she put him on a leash and led him away."  Ouch.  Her mother tells her daughter to "ask [her] friend why."  But she wouldn't, couldn't, and would rather die.  It turns out all this hate is the direct result of a mishearing.  Her friend never said she looked like a freak.  She said she looked neat.  </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>When parents see this book, they think it teaches how to hate.  But in the end, it is learned that all this hate was never necessary and could be a misunderstanding gone all wrong.&nbsp; What can one do in such a predicament? &nbsp; "Ask, ask your friend why." &nbsp; </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><em>The Hating Book</em> is a masterpiece that has been going strong for over 40 years.  All because, I think, some kids were willing to go beyond the cover.</div><div> </div>
