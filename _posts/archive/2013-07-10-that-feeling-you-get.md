I'm obsessed with the work of Nicholson Baker. &nbsp;I picked up a galley of <i>Traveling Sprinkler</i>, planning to write a blurb for his September 23rd event and be done with it, but instead I slipped and fell into his work, heading to <i>The Anthologist</i>, discovering an old copy of <i>The Mezzanine, </i>consuming <i>The Everlasting Story of Nory, </i>clutching <i>House of Holes</i>&nbsp;to my chest, surreptitiously ordering more while prowling the UBC for any more of his books. &nbsp;I can be accused of reading too much, swaths of my free time spent turning pages and collecting books. &nbsp;I love books, I love reading, but when I find a writing style that I just want to consume, devour, describe using language better suited for food--<br /><br />I guess I could do a string of exclamation points in an attempt to explain my feeling of exuberance, but that's not how it feels. &nbsp;I've found an author I enjoy so I'm going to ride off into the sunset, his books in my arms.
