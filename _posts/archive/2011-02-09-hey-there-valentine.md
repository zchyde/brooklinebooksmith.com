So, Monday is <em>that</em> holiday.&nbsp; For some it is a day of romance.&nbsp; Others, it is renamed Single Awareness Day.&nbsp; Then there are others who could care less; after all, Valentine's Day is a Hallmark and Hershey created holiday, right?<br /><br />One Valentine's Day book I find to be interesting is <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780689824296">Saint Valentine</a></em>, by Robert Sabuda.&nbsp; That's right, Valentine's Day does have a history beyond corporate sales.&nbsp; Even though there is more to this story than told here by Sabuda, one important&nbsp;reason for&nbsp;Valentine's Day was&nbsp;to send messages to ones we love, as St. Valentine did for one girl.&nbsp; The jailer's daughter had been blind since&nbsp;birth.&nbsp; Valentine, who was a preacher and a&nbsp;physician, was able to heal her sight.&nbsp;The next day, before his execution (as a Christian martyr),&nbsp;he sent&nbsp;the girl&nbsp;a compassionate letter signed "from your Valentine."&nbsp; <br /><br />It is also said that Valentine's Day is rooted from the "Roman feast of Lupercalia, which took place on February 15th, [the day after Valentine's execution]. One of the customs on this occasion involved the writing of love messages by maidens..."&nbsp; Though unmentioned in this book,&nbsp;I have also heard it said that near this time the Roman emperor outlawed marriage to increase his army in numbers.&nbsp; However, the army size decreased because men went to war to fight for their families, not to&nbsp;solely fight bloody battles or to&nbsp;please the emperor.&nbsp; Therefore, it could also be said that Valentine's Day is a celebration of marriage.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JqTVvu0SbXA/TVNEs3m7QfI/AAAAAAAAAOI/1Ni0suBJZYg/s1600/0978068982429_500X500.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" h5="true" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JqTVvu0SbXA/TVNEs3m7QfI/AAAAAAAAAOI/1Ni0suBJZYg/s320/0978068982429_500X500.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
