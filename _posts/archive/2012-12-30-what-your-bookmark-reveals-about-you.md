<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">This <a href="http://strandbooks.tumblr.com/post/39225669379/what-are-you-currently-using-as-a-bookmark" target="_blank">post </a>by the folks at the Strand brought me a little epiphany. The books we read often speak to our aspirations. They are small hand-held gurus or friends or vacations - temporary extensions in which we stretch our brains. But it's <i>bookmarks </i>that reveal our true selves; those meager scraps and pocket-scrapings tether us to reality like the string Theseus unwound on his way through the labyrinth. Our choice of anchor in a thousand-page sea says more about us than any astrological sign<span id="textmarked_0" name="textmarker_1" style="background-color: #33cc00;"></span>.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>Post-it notes</b> - You can't really remember your phone number or how old you are but you rule at pub trivia and have beautiful hand-writing.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b><a href="http://www.bookmobile.com/www/assets/Image/FrenchFlaps.jpg" target="_blank">French flap</a> </b>- you have a clean, tastefully appointed living room and a beagle named Darwin. </span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>Coolidge Theater ticket stub</b> - You're the rootless, aimless type. You've moved across country at least twice and harbor a little guilt at your lack of home-sickness but you feel nostalgic when you least expect it. You cried at this movie. You're a good person. Call your mother.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>Ribbon</b> - your cologne has top notes of pipe tobacco and sun-warmed leather and you own at least one steampunk accessory. In high school you were a borderline goth and your hair is enviably curly. You are literally the only person in the world who likes anchovy pizza.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>Something with an inspirational quote</b> - You own a juicer and went through a serious Joni Mitchell period.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>Something with a picture of a unicorn</b> - You've never tried karaoke but sweetheart, do it SOON because you don't know it yet but you have a voice worthy of the golden age of Radio - like a honey-soaked tiger purring an aria straight into the ear of God. </span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>$20 bill</b> - You know the power of a good&nbsp;incentive and aren't allowed to spend this until you finish Ulysses.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>JP Licks receipt</b> - You consider yourself brutally practical but clearly know when to indulge. You either are or will be a great parent/pet-owner.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>Smaller book</b> - You're intense. Your muscles have muscles. </span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>Polaroid</b> - You're the poster-child for vintage ephemera but hate the words "vintage" and "ephemera"&nbsp;almost as much as the people that use them.&nbsp;You're not really a people person at all, in fact. Maybe that's why you're preternaturally good at craigslist, that midden heap of virtual iniquity and cast-off treasure. You can sniff out the flea market gems faster than a bloodhound but you relish the hunt and&nbsp;have a soft spot for well-curated kitsch. We're all jealous of your record collection.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b><i>Bonus</i>: Dog-eared pages</b> - you actually <i>are</i> brutally practical. You're bound to survive the zombie apocalypse and the rest of us will follow you loyally into the dystopian future. Less than wisely, as it turns out: when push comes to shove you resort to cannibalism with nary a shrug.</span><br /><br />
