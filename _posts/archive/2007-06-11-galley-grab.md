Hello all! I thought I would offer up a couple galleys today. First come, first served. Just leave me a comment with the title of the book that interests you; I'll put the book on hold for you to pick up at the <a href="https://brooklinebooksmith.com/">store</a>.<br /><br /><strong><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9780385521093"><em>Mr. Sebastian and the Negro Magician</em> </a>by Daniel Wallace</strong><br />Here's a tip--this is going to be the #1 Book Sense pick for July. Stephen Grutzmacher from Passtimes Books in Sister Bay, WI said this: "Daniel Wallace tells the story of Henry Walker, a magician who disappears as a child and spends the rest of his life trying to make himself reappear. A haunting, beautifully written story where nothing, including the truth, is what it seems."<br /><br /><strong><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9780345494993"><em>Loving Frank</em> </a>by Nancy Horan</strong><br />Every year at BEA there is a panel called the "Buzz Forum," where editors from the major houses each give their pick for the upcoming season, and this was Suzanne Porter of Random House's choice. This is a debut novel, a fictional account of Frank Lloyd Wright and his affair with Mamah Cheney. <br /><br /><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9780385516402"><strong><em>The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court</em></strong> </a>by Jeffrey Toobin<br />Toobin gives a recent history of the Supreme Court with great access to the justices and other key players.<br /><br />Follow the links to read more about each.
