I have many new obsessions on a few of our new arrivals this week.  Here are two of them.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TBjDLkMN9uI/AAAAAAAAADg/bCM14djhtHA/s1600/9780375863448.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 212px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TBjDLkMN9uI/AAAAAAAAADg/bCM14djhtHA/s320/9780375863448.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5483347149784479458" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><br />The first one is an upper middle grade novel (for ages 10-14) titled <a style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);" href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780375863448"><span style="font-style: italic;">Rocky Road</span></a>.  I’ve actually been waiting for a couple of months for this title to be released!<br /><br />Tess is sick and tired of going along with her mother’s business plans because she never seems to finish the job right – literally!  Plus, who would want to move in the dead of winter to a no-name New York town with no money?  Not Tess; even though, they will be opening an ice cream store.  Unfortunately, her mother is driving full speed ahead to upstate New York from Texas and, “as it turned out, Ma’s wisest comment today was her warning Schenectady that the Dobsons were coming.”<br /><br />It’s hard to find a terrific, well written novel where the character is on the outlook for the needs of others.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Rocky Road</span> is definitely a 5 star quality scoop.  I couldn’t put it down the whole time I was reading it.  It was one of those books where, no matter how tired you are, you keep on pressing through to find out what happens.  And, when you're not reading, it replays like a great movie in your head.<br /><br />I’m also hoping <span style="font-style: italic;">Rocky Road</span> will win the <a href="http://www.ala.org/ala/awardsgrants/awardsrecords/schneideraward/schneiderfamily.cfm"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Schneider Award</span> </a>for 2011, as it encompasses the realities of living with a deaf younger brother so well, as well as another disability....<br /><br /><br />~~~<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TBjEgJBpgeI/AAAAAAAAADo/w9OxOBGRD9M/s1600/Petecover.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 263px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TBjEgJBpgeI/AAAAAAAAADo/w9OxOBGRD9M/s320/Petecover.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5483348602781270498" border="0" /></a><br />“Pete the cat was walking down the street in his brand new white shoes…”  This jazzy, blues loving cat does not let the world get him down, no matter what he steps in.  It’s rare that a song becomes a successful picturebook.  But<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"> </span><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780061906220">Pete the Cat</a></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"> </span>is purely the exception.  Take a look at a live reading from the author-illustrator team:<br /><br /><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/nUubMSfIs-U&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/nUubMSfIs-U&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1" allowscriptaccess="never" allowfullscreen="true" wmode="transparent" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="344" width="425"></embed></object><br /><br />Because it’s all good.
