I still dig <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780374518172">the original</a>...but the <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780374125585">new collected </a>offers something different. It offers her dirty napkins with scribbles, and calls them her "letters" and her "poems". Granted I love the idea of totally access to a writers private and public oeuvre, but there is something unsettling about it not being mindfully delineated from the rest of her intentionally "finished" poems. Thoughts? </div><br /><div></div><br /><div>(this doubtfulness offered in part by April Bernard and Paul Muldoon)</div></div>
