This year <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/"><em>Publisher's Weekly</em> </a>has been taking weekly in-depth looks at the state of book selling in each state; up recently was the great <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6444817.html?q=massachusetts">Commonwealth of Massachusetts</a>.

Exhibit A: Our information desk, lovingly referred to as Infosmith. Exhibit B: Brookline Blogsmith.
