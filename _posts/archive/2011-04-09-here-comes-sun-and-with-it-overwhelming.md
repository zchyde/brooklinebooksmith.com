Not only is this the best book for locomotion-motivation, it is also the perfect warm up read for the Boston Marathon. I cannot overstate how enthralling and fascinating this book is. My good-lord if you run (or walk) or shuffle even, this book is for you. So come in and meet the super cool Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Mc</span>-D and his crazy <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">amphiby</span>-feet that have taken the running world by storm.</div><br /><div></div><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 128px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 189px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5593656054135094354" border="0" alt="" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xSvRWcjE3NQ/TaCoi3ZvfFI/AAAAAAAAAOg/VlP8iFSpn2A/s400/b2r.jpg" /> <br /><div></div><br /><div>Running and reading share a similar place in my life. I feel sick when I don't practice them regularly, but I feel resentful sometimes they they are the world's best medicine. Have you ever regretted time you spent running or reading? Probably not (unless it was from the cops or the romance section.)</div><br /><div></div><br /><div>On a particularly pretty day like today, I always feel like an ass when I fail to jog, or pull out whatever I'm reading and sit outside. Nothing makes me feel more like I belong to the world like resonating with a killer collection of poems, good story, or an easy run. *Yet* how quickly we forget how simple little things like reading and running can entertain, fulfill, and even heal any ills you may be tending.</div><br /><div></div><br /><div>So- let's get out from behind our respective screens, strap on our sports bras and/or happy pants, and go for a run...and if we aren't up for that, let's read about the Ultra marathoners that do. For roughly 150 miles.</div><br /><div></div>
