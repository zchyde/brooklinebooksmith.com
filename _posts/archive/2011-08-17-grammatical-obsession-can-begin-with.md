Board books are great for babies and toddlers.&nbsp; But, give&nbsp;one to a ten-year-old, and you'll probably get a look of disdain.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-92BALg-4LLU/TkwdHMegfYI/AAAAAAAAAQs/Uxwll4h52kU/s1600/orange_pear_apple_bear.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; cssfloat: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="194" naa="true" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-92BALg-4LLU/TkwdHMegfYI/AAAAAAAAAQs/Uxwll4h52kU/s200/orange_pear_apple_bear.jpg" width="200" /></a></div>When handselling books, audience is key.&nbsp; You don't want to overwhelm someone by giving them a book that is way too hard or completely uninteresting. But you also don't want to insult someone with a book that is&nbsp;so easy they'd be embarrassed to be reading it -- even under the covers by flashlight.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there are books that transcend many age groups, and each time you read it -- no matter if you are six or seventy-two -- you always have a new experience.&nbsp; Really, this is the mark of an awesome book.<br /><br />Board books are great because they are durable enough to withstand bites, endless pulling, repeated whacking, and drool.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many fantastic books make their debut in beautifully jacketed hardcover picturebooks before becoming a board book, such as <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781442420038">Orange Pear Apple Bear</a></em> by Emily Gravett.&nbsp; I'm glad this book is finally in board because, sadly, many people mistake this book&nbsp;as a baby-ish book due to its count of five words&nbsp;and four objects.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, it's great for toddlers as well as five-year-olds, but what many people don't realize is that this book is quite sophisticated.&nbsp; It is not just a book about three pieces of fruit and a friendly bear.<br /><br />It's all about comma usage. "Orange, bear" basically means an orange and a bear.&nbsp; However, if you were to say "pear bear" then you must mean a pear colored bear.&nbsp; This is the perfect book for learning objects and language as a toddler.<em>&nbsp; Orange Pear</em> is&nbsp;also a great book for&nbsp;grammatical geeks who love to obsess over commas.<br /><br />Audience can be everything, but don't let it limit your reading list!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BZEYj78nzf0/TkwegtZL18I/AAAAAAAAAQw/jY2xUy4I5sU/s1600/bear.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" naa="true" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BZEYj78nzf0/TkwegtZL18I/AAAAAAAAAQw/jY2xUy4I5sU/s1600/bear.jpg" /></a></div>
