A lot of great new books have hit our shelves this week -- particularly some outstanding picturebooks.  Olivia is back, and she is still 100% Olivia, in <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781416996743"><span style="font-style: italic;">Olivia Goes to Venice</span></a>.  Holly Hobbie reminisces on her longing for her very own horse in <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316070195"><span style="font-style: italic;">Everything but the Horse</span></a>.  New in paperback is <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763649722"><span style="font-style: italic;">Penguin</span></a>, who prefers to not speak in words; and, what happens when a balloon filled with pirate chickens lands in the midst of Buccaneer Bunnies?  You get <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763649999"><span style="font-style: italic;">Henry and the Crazed Chicken Pirates.</span> </a><br /><br />And now the best for last!  <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780061929571"><span style="font-style: italic;">Knuffle Bunny Free</span></a><br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TKP6I07qJaI/AAAAAAAAAKI/XnNjW8BfGXc/s1600/Knuffle+Bunny+Free.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 241px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TKP6I07qJaI/AAAAAAAAAKI/XnNjW8BfGXc/s320/Knuffle+Bunny+Free.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5522532597641127330" border="0" /></a><br />Trixie has once again misplaced Knuffle Bunny -- this time on an international flight.  But can Knuffle Bunny really last forever?  Maybe it is time to say goodbye to such a child's toy.  But, the relationship between a child and that one very loved stuffed animal is more than precious, it is essential!  Knuffle Bunny is Trixie's best friend and they did everything together.  Nothing can compare to this blue eared fluff of a bunny.<br /><br />Some prefer not to believe that there comes a day when you outgrow your plush childhood best friend (and the others ones that come along too).  Is there one good reason to give up such a friend?  And, if so, how?  Why?<br /><br />Mo Willems gives a great persepective on this quandary of an issue.<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TKP6a36Fg7I/AAAAAAAAAKQ/QS3p6UEPZ38/s1600/knufflebunny1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 100px; height: 100px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TKP6a36Fg7I/AAAAAAAAAKQ/QS3p6UEPZ38/s320/knufflebunny1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5522532907677483954" border="0" /></a>
