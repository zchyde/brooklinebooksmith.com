Now I know that the current weather <a href="http://weather.boston.com/">forecast </a>for Saturday says rain, but in the spirit of optimism I thought I would post about a nifty event happening over on the Common this Saturday from 11:00 AM to 5:00 PM rain or shine--the Boston Globe's <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/promotions/childrenbookfest/">Children's Book Festival</a>.<br /><br />They have really great authors scheduled--my highlights would be seeing Jane O'Connor who writes the <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780060542092"><strong><em>Fancy Nancy</em></strong> </a>books and Jarrett J. Krosoczka who wrote <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780375824296"><strong><em>Punk Farm</em></strong> </a>and is, according to Alison, the children's book buyer at <a href="http://www.wellesleybooksmith.com/">Wellesley Booksmith</a>, a really fantastic guy (you can read about the event Wellesley Booksmith did with him <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/blog/660000266/post/1750016375.html">here</a>).<br /><br />If you go let me know how it is--my Saturday will be spent working here at the store!
