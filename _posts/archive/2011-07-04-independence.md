I've never cared for the decorations. The screaming. That being what it is, fireworks are lovely,--but what a weird way to celebrate...."hey look up there in the sky...remember the noises bombs made when we killed people?" I wonder if the squirrels know we are only playing pretend-bombs, technicolor bombs.<br /><br />At the register today I had a surge of pride, our country is only 235 years old. How lucky I am to be on this land. How lucky that I can yell, and criticise and bitch to anyone I want, that my mouth is protected. Think of all the inventions that came for from this country...(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_United_States_inventions">seriously...check out <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Wikipedia</span>.</a>) We were borne from brilliant extremist rogue savants.<br /><br />I think about how glad I am to work where I work. How there is something in this store to offend everyone, and to please everyone. How <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Brookline</span> chooses everyday, to support this store, and how grateful we are to try and reflect back the fierce intellectual independence of this town.<br /><br />Enjoy your independence, and your independents.
