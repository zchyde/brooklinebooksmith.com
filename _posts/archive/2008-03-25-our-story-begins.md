It's a collection of his short stories--some previously published, some new. I'm really thrilled--<a href="http://brooklinebooksmith.blogspot.com/2008/01/winter-institute-part-two.html">as I've mentioned before</a>, his novel <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780375701498"><strong><em>Old School</em></strong> </a>is one of my all-time favorite novels. I really don't have much else to say--I just wanted to point out that Tobias Wolff is an awesome writer and you should read his books. That's all. Sometimes there just isn't much more than that. Oh, except that he'll be reading here on April 7th and you should get your <a href="http://brooklinebooksmith.com/Events/MainEvent.html">tickets </a>now (I think this might be a sell-out--tickets for our event with <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780307265739">Jhumpa Lahiri </a>are already gone!). </div>
