Also just came across <a href="https://www.matteroftrust.org/programs/hairmatsinfo.html">this organization</a> which collects pet fur and uses it to help clean up the oil spill. They come highly recommended. A full rundown of the procedure and other ways to help in the clean up can be had on their website. No amount is too small.
