I'm writing this hurriedly on Friday in anticipation of one of the busiest weekends of the year outside of the winter holiday season. Mid-to-late spring is a time for life changes for many people. All around us, new graduates are blooming. People are moving out of dorms or across the country. Others are retiring after many years of hard work. And of course, the weekend that's in the future for me and in the past for you included Mother's Day, and Father's Day is just around the corner.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/v/9780679805274" style="background-color: #eeeeee; clear: right; color: #4b5cc3; float: right; font-family: 'Helvetica neue', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; text-align: center; text-decoration: none;"><img src="http://images.booksense.com/images/books/274/805/FC9780679805274.JPG" style="border: 0px;" title="Oh, the Places You'll Go!" /></a>The amazing thing is, all of those things seem to lead people to buy books. And though many of the occasions commonly celebrated now aren't directly about kids, it's a big time for kids' books. Adults about to move away come in looking for books to give their students, their babysitting clients, their beloved young neighbors. Parents and students come looking for classroom gifts or books for retiring teachers. Families buy books about honoring moms for Mother's Day and dads for Father's Day. And if you know someone who's moving on, chances are you're looking for <i>Oh, The Places You'll Go!</i>&nbsp;(We have it in spades in our graduation display, along with lots of other books about moving up and making your mark.)<br /><br />Everything comes back to kids' books. Just sayin'. Happy May!<br /><br /><br />
