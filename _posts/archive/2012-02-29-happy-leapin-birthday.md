Josie Taylor's birthday is today, but is she 4 or 16?&nbsp; She may feel like every other&nbsp;teenager at times, but only her and a few others share this rare birthday of February 29th.&nbsp;With her driver's test, an audition, scaveneger hunt, and&nbsp;16th birthday initiation at the lake,&nbsp;it's a birthday to remember.&nbsp; The unique factor in <em><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316058285">Leap Day</a></em> is that the point of view shifts from various characters, inviting the reader&nbsp;to percieve many situations from various sides.&nbsp; And often, you may be surprised about how often you misread situations or over-worry about them.&nbsp; Or not.<br /><br />If you haven't been swept away by author Wendy Mass, you must give her a chance -- especially female readers 10 and up.&nbsp; The only complaint I have had about this author is from <em><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316058254">A Mango Shaped Space</a></em> -- only because this young lady's best friend wouldn't shut up about how great it was.&nbsp; I recommend <em>Leap Day</em> for readers twelve and up.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zgocmFFdboM/T06X89yNWvI/AAAAAAAAAVg/7Jind9EZrjM/s1600/Leap-Day-cover.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zgocmFFdboM/T06X89yNWvI/AAAAAAAAAVg/7Jind9EZrjM/s1600/Leap-Day-cover.jpg" /></a></div>
