It's confession time.  In one way, I am a sham of a bookseller.  Some who know me outside of the bookstore will already be aware of this.  Others may be shocked and upset.  I hope one and all will realize that I am, truly, the real deal book person in spite of what I'm about to reveal.  Rest assured, I do know and love books and have done so for my whole life.<div><br /></div><div>Okay, here goes.  When someone(and of course, MANY do, given my job), out in public, family or friend or new acquaintance  asks me THE question, I freeze.  My mind goes blank.  I hem and haw and look thoughtful.  I try to picture the shelves of the store and lists posted near the register,  wishing for a photographic memory.   I attempt to summon up all the trade press I read daily and weekly.  Nothing works.</div><div><br /></div><div>What's THE question, you ask?   WHAT'S SELLING IN THE STORE?  So innocent.  So reasonable.  At a social occasion recently, the answer I gave was, "  Oh, some - um - well, fiction, good fiction.  And - um - also nonfiction - there's alot of good nonfiction right now."  The person asking looked a bit puzzled but smiled encouragingly.  I, too, smiled and said, laughing, " So...that - um - certainly covers it, right?".   We both laughed.  She drifted away.  Who wouldn't? </div><div><br /></div><div>This happens over and over again.  I don't know why.  I've tried to change to no avail.  I vow to keep trying.  It's only been 29 years at the bookstore.  There's plenty of time, right?</div>
