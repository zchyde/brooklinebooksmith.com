It's my New Year's Resolution. My trick is to listen to the audiobook while I walk to work from Allston. Not only am I making record progress, but it's also a great book to listen through this mega snowy winter. It keeps me from complaining as I walk through blizzard-like snows when the troops I'm listening about are marching for weeks with no boots. SOOOO I thought I'd pick this scene.<br /><br />Chase away the snowstorm blahs with this fun lil game from your humble basement dwellers in the UBC!<br /><br /><b>Send in your completed Mad Lib, and whichever we judge the funniest will get a <u>free used book (priced under $10.

Though the words of the order were not _<u>ADJECTIVE</u>_ to the regimental commander, and the question arose whether the troops were to be in _<u>VERB</u>_ order or not, it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders to present the regiment in _<u>NOUN</u>_&nbsp;order, on the principle that it is always better to "bow too low than not bow low enough." So the soldiers, after a twenty-mile march, were kept _<u>VERB</u>_ and _<u>VERB</u>_ all night long without closing their eyes, while the adjutants and company commanders _<u>VERB</u>_ and _<u>VERB</u>_, and by morning the regiment instead of the straggling, disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day before presented a well-ordered array of two thousand men each of whom knew his _<u>NOUN</u>_ and his _<u>NOUN</u>_, had every _<u>NOUN</u>_ and every _<u>NOUN</u>_ in place, and shone with cleanliness. And not only externally was all in order, but had it pleased the commander in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean _<u>NOUN</u>_, and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles, "_<u>NOUN (1)</u>_, _<u>NOUN (2)</u>_, and _<u>NOUN (rhymes with 1)</u>_," as the soldiers say. There was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease. It was the state of the soldiers' _<u>NOUN</u>_. More than half the men's _<u>NOUN</u>_ were in _<u>NOUN</u>_. But this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander, for in spite of repeated demands _<u>NOUN</u>_ had not been _<u>VERB</u>_ by the Austrian _<u>NOUN</u>_, and the regiment had _<u>NOUN</u>_ some seven hundred miles.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><b>E-mail your submissions to ubc@brooklinebooksmith.com!
