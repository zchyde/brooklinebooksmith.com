And I have it cut out for me, too. People are moving out, there's a long weekend ahead and a lot of people are in selling books. It certainly makes the day move faster but it also means that we are seeing a lot of books, and we can't give them all homes. So to make sure that you don't waste a trip by bringing in books we might pass on, this is just a friendly suggestion for those wanting to sell back to call in or e-mail a list of the titles you have and we can help you whittle your pile down to&nbsp;stuff that we can use.<br /><br /><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jHeWUO3aS4I/T761nTlT8eI/AAAAAAAAAdM/gwlx75Wcj38/s1600/Novelization_The-Cabin-in-the-Woods_042012.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jHeWUO3aS4I/T761nTlT8eI/AAAAAAAAAdM/gwlx75Wcj38/s200/Novelization_The-Cabin-in-the-Woods_042012.jpg" width="121" /></a>But a ton of new arrivals mean there are a lot of cool new books in the store. CAN YOU HANDLE IT? Just in time for Memorial Day weekend and the upcoming summer:<br /><br />The novelization of <i>The Cabin in the Woods</i>, a graphic novel of Sherlock Holmes' stories, a copy of <i>The Confederacy of Dunces </i>(read it before<a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2012/0524/A-Confederacy-of-Dunces-to-hit-the-big-screen-with-Zach-Galifianakis"> the movie comes out</a>), <i>The Tiger's Wife</i>, <i>Longing for the Harmonies, </i>a book on consciousness and physics, a complete book of Keats' poems, basically just a major haul of awesome for any sort of reader: casual to die-hard. Stop in for the one you're looking for or to get a recommendation from any one of us&nbsp;lovable&nbsp;weirdos.<br /><br />And remember, we're real passionate about books around here, but remember to never drink or drive: <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/21/illinois-twilight-fan-arrested_n_1105740.html">read about this teenager in Illinois</a> who got so mad when her boyfriend didn't take her to see the new <i>Twilight </i>movie that she crashed her car.
