By now most of the internet has seen the on-set snaps of Jason Segel costumed for his role as David Foster Wallace in the upcoming film adaptation of David Lipsky's <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780307592439" target="_blank">Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself: a Road Trip With David Foster Wallace</a>. Things look awkward to say the least, so let's get the requisite nail-biting and seat-squirming out of the way now. <br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QeuFHYIwLF8/U0g8aC3wbmI/AAAAAAAAAG4/xKQNc083_n4/s1600/Jason_Segel_David_Foster_Wallace.png.CROP.promo-mediumlarge.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QeuFHYIwLF8/U0g8aC3wbmI/AAAAAAAAAG4/xKQNc083_n4/s1600/Jason_Segel_David_Foster_Wallace.png.CROP.promo-mediumlarge.png" height="285" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr align="left"><td class="tr-caption">Photo credit <a href="http://instagram.com/vaness246oh1#" target="_blank">Vanessa Andrade</a></td></tr></tbody></table>I tend to agree with <a href="http://lazenby.tumblr.com/post/69842768064/what-do-you-think-about-jason-segel-playing-dfw-in-a" target="_blank">George Lazenby</a> on this one:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">If I wanted to design a personal hell for David Foster Wallace, I would <br /><ul><li>summon a golem from the ashes of his strangled body,</li><li>put a $ on its forehead,</li><li>deprive it of the third dimension,</li><li>reduce it to a quaking shadow,</li><li>and project it on screen after screen after screen,</li><li>to prop up a road movie with the kid from facebook. </li></ul></blockquote>BUT  since so much of DFW's work struggles against the modern tendency  toward bitter cynicism and ironic detachment, I'll reserve judgement on  this one until it hits the box office.<br /><br />Haven't read DFW yet? Most (all) people start with (and quickly give up on) <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316066525" target="_blank">Infinite Jest</a>, the author's 1,100+ page opus. Our staff STRONGLY recommends you instead try <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316925280" target="_blank">A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again</a> - the author's best essay collection is every bit as brilliant and biting as his fiction, and much shorter.
