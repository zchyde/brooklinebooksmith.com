Inspiration comes from familiar, unique places and experiences.  One of mine is my favorite movies, <em>You've Got Mail</em> -- if you know me you need no explanation on why this is. So, I was reading over an <a href="http://sfy.ru/?script=youve_got_mail">original script</a> and -- oh, my -- so much has changed between the script and the final cut.  Most of the cut scenes I am very glad they altered or removed, as they take away from the integrity of the movie.  But there's one line I wish they had kept in: "My mother would never have wanted us to have a website.  'Every book you sell is a gift from your heart.'  She always said that."<br /><div>&nbsp;</div><div>At first I completely agreed with this, <em>every book you sell is from the heart</em>.  But as I mulled it over, I believe it is more appropriate to say "every book <u>you</u> give is a gift from your heart."  Though I recommend books I love and feel strongly about, they aren't always from my heart.  They can't be.  For instance, when a customer asks what book to give for a <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780810993136">Wimpy Kid</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780786838653">Percy Jackson</a></em> fan (two series I respect but aren't a fan of), I'm going to recommend <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781570917189">Mystic Phyles</a></em>.  I'm not partial to this book, but I recommend it because it is what they are looking for -- it is what their literary attention is craving.  My goal, as a bookseller, is to give (a) a great piece of literature, (b) provide the customer with a book they will love and is appropriate for them.  </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I am not the one ultimately giving the book to this child I have never met. I am simply providing an important direction.  Therefore, I think it is the gift from the giver that should be given from the heart.  It's painful when when a customer chooses a random book with little to no thought as to whether the recipient will love or learn from it.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div> </div><div>Almost always, even if I am hand selling the most inspirational book I've read all year, there's a choice that trumps it.  I encourage customers to give a gift that they have a connection with.  So, if someone is looking for a gift for a young girl and they loved a particular book, like, <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780064401883">The Secret Garden</a></em>, and it changed their life, I will encourage them to go with <em>The Secret Garden</em>.  Not only will their enthusiasm rub off on the givee, but there will be a connection made from the givee to the giver.  Too often, gifts are just random objects, when they really should be pieces of ourselves.&nbsp; Gifts should be personal.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div> </div>
