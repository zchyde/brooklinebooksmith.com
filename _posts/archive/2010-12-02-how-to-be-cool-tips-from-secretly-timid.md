It would not be going too far to describe it as a </span><em><span class="Apple-style-span">romp) </span></em><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">slappin</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span">' on a dress and some leggings and chugging a Dogfish Head 90 Minute (why do you taste better than love ever did??), I headed down to the Coolidge Corner Theatre and watched my friend Katie deliver a quite hilarious introduction of the one and only Amy </span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">Sedaris</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span">, who then showed us how to do some crafts and fielded questions from the audience. Both ladies were delightful, and I was seated pretty far back but if you asked the front row I'm sure they'll confirm that Amy moves with the undying grace of the ages and smells like sweet lotus blossoms falling on a temperate spring pool. I don't know, I'm guessing.</span></span></p><p><span style="color:#000000;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Afterwards I let myself be carried off with the crowd to the </span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">Booksmith</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"> to get my book signed. I always have a lot of bravado when I get in the line, and then as I get closer and closer to celebrity, I slowly remember that I am naturally a shy and apologetic person and by the time I get to the fame I've compromised myself down to not making eye contact, barely muttering a response to any and all questions asked of me, and shuffling out of the line as fast as I can so not to get in the way. You might not think that this would be my survival technique </span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">dujour</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"> from meeting me or reading these online blog posts, but I am meek, </span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">internets</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span">. I am a quiet coyote. I'm a note leaver and a letter writer, the type to avoid confrontation at any cost. I fully intend to inherit the earth. </span></span></p><p><span style="color:#000000;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Sometimes I make it pretty far with high hopes ("I'm gonna ask for a picture and tell him/her that I loved him/her on that one thing they did and they'll laugh and we'll probably be </span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">BFF</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"> 4 life and get each others initials shaved in the backs of our heads...") and then the Famous People Handlers are so businesslike and they don't smile and they manhandle my property in some way to make sure I don't have a bomb or chloroform and I totally lose footing. Then its just all downhill from there, I start babbling and making that nervous laughter that sounds like a dying pelican because I can't stop breathing and laughing simultaneously so at this point I'm alternating between some kind of half hearted giggle and taking huge, life affirming gulps of air...</span></span></p><p><span style="color:#000000;"><span class="Apple-style-span">So the moral of that story is I was too shy to ask for a picture and now I regret it. At least I got to bask in the sunshine of Amy's presence for a few cherished seconds, and I have a personalized signed copy of Amy's book. The </span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">inscription </span></span><span class="Apple-style-span">reads: "Zoe - Keep sharing your needles, skein brain." Although, to be honest, when she asked me if I crafted and I said "I knit. A little." What I </span><em><span class="Apple-style-span">meant</span></em><span class="Apple-style-span"> was, I once knitted a scarf in 2007 that is too wide and has little </span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">fuzzies</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"> wherever I switched colors because I don't know how to do stripes and I haven't really picked up the needles since because I am unable to learn things right now that don't have to do with getting a degree or getting paid. Details.</span></span></p><p><span style="color:#000000;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Actually the meat of this blog post ("What? It's...it's not over?" I hear you, trust me, imagine </span><em><span class="Apple-style-span">living</span></em><span class="Apple-style-span"> in this brain. Its like an over-loud sports bar all the time except playing on the speakers is not sports announcers, its my own constant neurosis and narrative.

I'm 13, maybe 14. I'm dumpy, I'm awkward, and I'm accompanied by my mom at Margaret </span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">Cho's</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"> reading of her autobiography, "I'm The One That I Want". First off, it's 2002, I assume the </span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">Booksmith</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"> and the Coolidge Corner Theatre have not yet formed the love bond that they have now, but even in addition to that Margaret is not yet a superstar, so the reading is in the Readers and Writers room, downstairs in the bookstore. </span></span></p><p><span style="color:#000000;"><span class="Apple-style-span">I am mere feet away from Margaret </span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_13" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">Cho</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"> as she reads from her autobiography about all of her sexual adventures and misadventures and wetting the bed, all the trappings of future stardom. I've just started 8</span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_14" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">th</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"> grade and moved to Winchester street, and all these new things are happening to my body! Hair in new places! Weird feelings! Zits, </span></span><a href="mailto:argh!!@!!"><span style="color:#000000;"><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_15" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">argh</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span">!1!!!</span></span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_16" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">Cho's</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_17" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">sexplicit</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"> (I just made that word up, move over Shakespeare/Sarah </span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_18" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">Palin</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span">) life is something I have trouble relating to but I read the biography and loved it because I love Margaret, she is so funny and honest, and aside from all the underground S&amp;M dungeon stuff, an excellent role model. After the reading we got to meet her and have the book signed, and my mom mentioned how much we loved a stand up show she did at the Wang, and I was deeply and fundamentally embarrassed by her sheer existence. This was neither the first or last time that would happen. You are embarrassed by your parents until you become them, and then you have to be embarrassed by yourself like an adult. </span></span></p><p><span style="color:#000000;"><span class="Apple-style-span">My number two greatest all time </span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_19" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">Booksmith</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"> author talk was Linda Barry circa 2007</span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_20" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">ish</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span">. Linda Barry, if you don't know her, is absolutely amazing. I found out about her when I was 10 and </span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_21" class="blsp-spelling-corrected"><span class="Apple-style-span">preferred</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"> reading cartoon anthologies at the Newton Public Library to (ugh) talking to children my own age (gross). That reading could be a blog post all of its own, how she started out singing to calm her nerves, or how she's so great because she promotes art as something accessible to everybody which I totally dig because in all facets I'm a dabbler and a </span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_22" class="blsp-spelling-corrected"><span class="Apple-style-span">dilettante</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"> which makes me suspicious about anything you need training for.</span></span></p><p><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#000000;">I was still in art school at the time, trying to figure out if I belonged there, (and if not there, then where?) so I was asking myself a lot of questions about drive and motivation. Barry is so passionate in person, the way she talks about learning how to draw and express herself through art made me think about my own expression and art, who I created for and why. She was inspiring and hopeful, and I've always thought I should write her a letter but I never have. </span></p><p><span style="color:#000000;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Amy </span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_23" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">Sedaris</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"> can go in as my number three favourite all time author talk, although I have been to many more. Because she was amazing but also because I've already made this post too long and I'm going to get those awkward responses to it that are like "</span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_24" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">Ohh</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span">, </span><em><span class="Apple-style-span">loved</span></em><span class="Apple-style-span"> the blog post Zoe, only took me half an hour to read it, its the perfect length since I don't have anything better to do in my life than read your gargantuan </span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_25" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">cyber</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_26" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">natterings</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span">. OBLIGATORY EYE ROLL." And I'm like "I'M SORRY ITS AN ADDICTION" and then they're like "You already have an addiction its called alcoholism" and I'm like "</span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_27" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span class="Apple-style-span">oooh</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span">, low blow, Mom, low blow. Hand me that bottle opener." </span></span></p><p><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#000000;">Sorry. Those...those are my issues.
