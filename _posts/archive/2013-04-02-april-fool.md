<span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">I confess: <a href="http://brooklinebooksmith.blogspot.com/2013/04/only-9-shopping-months-until-christmas.html">that last blog</a> post </span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">was a lie. Excited as we are to put out holiday books again, we also love the rest of the year. Including April Fools' Day. Looking for December holiday books? Come back in... okay, October.</span></span>
