When I was buying it my rep mentioned how much she (and her dinner guests) liked the Citrus Collards with Raisins Redux she made. And <a href="https://brooklinebooksmith.blogspot.com/2009/01/staff-picks-katie.html">Katie </a>has already picked up a copy and told me how much she loved the Cajun-Creole-Spiced Tempeh Pieces with Creamy Grits. </div><br /><div>I was always bummed that I couldn't eat a lot of Southern cooking as it usually involves foods I don't eat (shellfish and pork in particular) so I am so thrilled to have some delicious soul food I can try. My mouth is seriously watering just looking at the table of contents...I want some sweet, sour, and spicy blackberry limeade and carrot-cranberry-walnut salad <em>now</em>! And I love how each recipe comes with a soundtrack (for example, Bo Diddley's "I'm a Man" is suggested for garlic broth-braised brussels sprouts). </div><br /><div>This book is seriously good--not just for vegans but for anyone looking for some new inspiration. Check it out! (and check out more from Bryant Terry <a href="https://www.bryant-terry.com/">here</a>).</div><br /><div>By the way, if you are vegan (or just looking to eat more veggies) you should send a big hug and kiss to the folks of <a href="https://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/dacapo/">Da Capo Press</a>. Their spring/summer list is packed full of the most amazing vegan cookbooks one after another (and we'll be carrying all of them). Check it out:</div><br /><div>March: The aforementioned <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780738212289"><em>Vegan Soul Kitchen</em> </a>by Bryant Terry</div><br /><div>May: <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780738213064"><strong><em>Ani's Raw Food Desserts</em></strong> </a>by Ani Phyo (who wrote our bestselling raw food cookbook, <em><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781600940002">Ani's Raw Food Kitchen</a></em>)</div><br /><div>June: <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780738212722"><strong><em>Vegan Brunch</em></strong> </a>by Isa Chandra Moskowitz (who wrote our bestselling vegan cookbook, <em><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781569242643">Veganomicon</a></em>)</div><br /><div>July: <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780738213279"><strong><em>The 30-Minute Vegan: 150 Quick, Delicious, and Healthy Recipes for Everyday Cooking</em></strong> </a>by Mark Reinfeld and Jennifer Murray</div><br /><div>Honestly, if I were vegan I'd be doing a happy dance right about now. </div>
