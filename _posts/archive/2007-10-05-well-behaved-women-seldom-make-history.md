Last week I read a great article from <em>The Guardian</em>, titled "<a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,,2177244,00.html">The Books That Changed Our Lives</a>," in which a number of young feminists write about the books that introduced them to feminism. I was particularly <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">interested</span> to read what Jessica Valenti and Ariel Levy wrote as they are currently the authors of my two favorite books in our women's studies section: <strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781580052016">Full Frontal Feminism: A Young Woman's Guide to Why Feminism Matters</a></em></strong> and <strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780743284288">Female Chauvinist Pigs: Women and the Rise of <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Raunch</span> Culture</a></em></strong>, respectively.<br /><br />In case you're not familiar with women's history I highly recommend Laurel Thatcher Ulrich's new book, <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781400041596"><strong><em>Well Behaved Women Seldom Make History</em></strong></a>. In it she uses three historical figures--Christine <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">de</span> <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Pizan</span>, Elizabeth <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">Cady</span> Stanton, and Virginia Woolf--as a way to enter into the various roles women have played throughout history. Dr. Ulrich has a great way of making history more than just a straight linear narrative--in this book she breaks patterns and helps the reader see new connections between historical periods, which is something I really admire (and wish was done by historians more often).<br /><br />There isn't anything really new in <em>Well Behaved Women Seldom Make History</em>, though I think the writing style and book structure makes the book interesting even for someone who is fairly well-read in women's history. If you do fancy yourself an ace at the subject though, then I would recommend instead picking up <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781400041596"><strong><em>The Girls Who Went Away: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe V. Wade</em></strong> </a>by Ann <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">Fessler</span>. As someone who considers herself well-read, I couldn't believe I had never learned about the experience of unwed mothers (especially those who were white and middle-class), the institutions they were sent to, and the way adoption worked in the mid-20<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">th</span> century. It's an incredibly powerful book.
