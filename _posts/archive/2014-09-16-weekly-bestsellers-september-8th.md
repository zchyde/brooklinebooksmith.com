<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Weekly Bestsellers </b></div><br />Second week of September and our events series is kicking into gear. Topping the hardcover list we have two events books. We hosted Joyce Carol Oates, a woman who is prolific in both book form <a href="https://twitter.com/JoyceCarolOates" target="_blank">and on Twitter</a>, and she joined us at the Coolidge Corner Theatre to read from her <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062356949">new collection of short stories</a>. And on Saturday,&nbsp;<a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/">Chris Guillabeau</a> visited every country in the world and shared the lessons he learned with us at his event for <i><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780385348843">The Happiness of Pursuit</a>.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i>In paperbacks, once-local author Dennis Lehane's novel <i><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/%5Bmodel%5D-987">The Drop</a></i>, is adapted from <a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/thedrop/">the film</a> which was originally adapted from Lehane's short story "Animal Rescue." Got that? And for those of us who can't get enough of the brilliant Roxane Gay (and there are a lot of us, customers and staff alike) we are thrilled her essay collection,&nbsp;<i><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/%5Bmodel%5D-925">Bad Feminist</a>,</i>&nbsp;is out as a paperback original.<i>&nbsp;</i><br /><span style="text-align: center;"><br /></span><span style="text-align: center;">Here's the rest of the list.
