It's the story of Marvin, a beetle whose family lives under the Pompaday's kitchen sink in New York City. Marvin discovers his hidden talent for drawing when he creates a birthday present for James, the eleven-year-old boy who lives in the apartment the beetles call home. Even more important than his discovery of his talents, however, is Marvin's discovery of a true friendship with James. Marvin's talents lead Beetle and boy to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where they try to help uncover who has been stealing Durer drawings.</div><br /><div></div><br /><div><em>Masterpiece</em> reminded me of some of my absolute, all-time favorite stories from childhood-- <em><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780689711817">From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler</a></em> (Claudia and Jamie are siblings who run away to the Metropolitan Museum of Art--they shower in fountains and sleep on historic beds!--and try to discover the secrets of a beautiful sculpture), <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780152047375"><em>The Borrowers</em> </a>(a family of teeny-tiny people who create an entire world underneath the floorboards just like Marvin's family), and <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780064400558"><em>Charlotte's Web</em> </a>(I was reminded of the beautiful descriptions of friendships--and the unexpected talents of a bug!). That's some seriously heady company to be keeping, and Masterpiece pulls it off beautifully. Three cheers! </div>
