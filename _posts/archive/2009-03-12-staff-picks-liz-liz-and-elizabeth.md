More staff picks! I realized I need to go through them quickly as there are a whole new batch that will be going up in a few weeks (which means I need to decide what my next pick will be...I saw that Jennifer 8 Lee's <strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780446698979">The Fortune Cookie Chronicles</a></em></strong> just came in today which upends my shortlist).<br /><br />Elizabeth recommends <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780393333060"><strong><em>The Zookeeper's Wife: A War Story</em></strong> </a>by Diane Ackerman: "This book gives new meaning to selflessness. It's the story of a family and countless others who put themselves in the face of evil to help others to stand up for what's right. Could you do the same?"<br /><br />Liz E., who spends much of her time in our children's section, loves <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780061130977"><strong><em>If You Were a Penguin</em></strong> </a>by Wendell and Florence Minor: "I have been a fan of Wendell Minor for years -- his illustrations are wonderful, capturing the very essence of each story he helps to bring alive! This one is just wonderful -- plus, it's all about penguins! Can you toboggan on your stomach or fly underwater?"<br /><br />And Liz T. suggests <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781579127725"><strong><em>The Academy Awards: The Complete Unofficial History</em></strong> </a>by Gail Kinn and Jim Piazza: "I love old movies and movie history. My cable box is permanently set on Turner Classic Movies. This book sits on the bookcase next to the couch for quick and easy reference. In addition to the lists of winners and nominees, there's also a lot of great trivia. Love it!"<br /><br />Read more of their recommendations <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=storepicks&amp;page=256151">here</a>, <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=storepicks&amp;page=222616">here</a>, and <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=storepicks&amp;page=231202">here</a>.<br /><br />By the way, in case you were wondering, in addition to the Liz trio we also have Kate F., Kate R., &amp; Katie as well as both Lisa F. and Lisa P.
