I am so ready to go home, but I saw Bruno currently unpacking some fantastic cookbook remainders and I couldn't not spread the word. I don't know how Alie did it, but we have Ana Sortun's <em><strong>Spice: Flavors of the Eastern Mediterranean</strong></em> for $14.99. Holy hell, I can't believe it!<br /><br />Man, I was lucky enough to go to <a href="http://www.oleanarestaurant.com/index.asp">Oleana </a>once, and I can vividly remember the heavenly deliciousness. I hope I'll have a special occasion that calls for a return visit someday soon. Well, that and someone willing to pick up the check...
