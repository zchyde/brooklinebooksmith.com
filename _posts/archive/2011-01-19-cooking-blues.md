Sometimes I wonder if cooking is overrated.&nbsp; Specific ingredients.&nbsp; Long hours in the kitchen.&nbsp; Debates between chefs, brands, and what is considered to be healthy.&nbsp; There's the sink full of dishes...&nbsp; <br /><br />Then again, in some shape or form, food is absolutely necessary to be able to go on living -- especially if you are one who keeps close watch as to what you put in your mixing bowl.&nbsp; When done right,&nbsp;food is down right amazing.&nbsp;Therefore, cooking definitely has high rankings in life.&nbsp; (No wonder we have so many great cookbooks here!).&nbsp; <br /><br />Got the cooking blues and&nbsp;are not sure what to make on this stretch of snow and rainy days?&nbsp; Sometimes I find myself turning pages until I find something good or go back to a long forgotten favorite.<br /><br />I highly recommend <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780738213613"><i>Gluten Free Italian</i></a>.&nbsp; It&nbsp;is sure to be a homey pleaser, and it is one of the top selling gluten free books we have.&nbsp; Within this cookbook there are many meals that don't contain wheat and are low in sugar.&nbsp; Try the Spinach and Potato Frittata, breadsticks, Focaccia bread, and the various fettuccine dishes. So far, everything I've made so far has been absolutely delicious.<br /><br />If you have to eat, you might as well make the best of it right?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TTcQiczkc2I/AAAAAAAAANo/BojIhmBqRuI/s1600/9780738213613.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TTcQiczkc2I/AAAAAAAAANo/BojIhmBqRuI/s320/9780738213613.jpg" width="244" /></a></div>
