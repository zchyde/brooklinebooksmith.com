I've spent the past two days unpacking my belongings and settling into my new apartment. &nbsp;Instead of figuring out where the trash and recycling goes, I've been creating reading nooks. &nbsp;I've moved the furniture at least three times already, seeing how the light hits at different points of the day and how it works with the rest of the room. <br /><br />The thing I haven't yet gotten to is my collection of books. &nbsp;Unpacking books promising hours of sifting through pages, looking up book cover designers, and organizing them into random categories, all things I love. &nbsp;I save this for last, long after I've put away my clothes, assembled all the furniture, and rearranged all of the silverware in the most accessible fashion. &nbsp;This time, I've told myself I won't double stack. I'll keep my books in check and buy more bookshelves when I need them, but I know what these shelves will look like in three months. &nbsp;They will be haphazard, stacked in piles, threatening to fall off the shelf or squash another book. &nbsp;They will have been opened and read, loved and lent out. &nbsp;They will contain notes, receipts, and currency. &nbsp;Some will be in perfect condition, some will have bent pages, some will have warped pages from being read in the tub. &nbsp;Their number will grow as I get used to the new place, and when it's time to move out I'll do it all over again.<br /><br />
