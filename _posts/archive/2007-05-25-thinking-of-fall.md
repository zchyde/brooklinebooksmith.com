Sorry to have been quiet, but it's getting quite busy here in the <a href="https://brooklinebooksmith.com/">Brookline Booksmith </a>basement as Fall Buying Season began in earnest for me today. Though hot enough to sweat while standing still outisde (my barometer for when it's too hot), I spent my day trying to figure out what you all will want to take home in November and December.<br /><br />Going through publishers' catalogs is more like fun than work. Everything looks good, or, at least, it should if the publishers' marketing teams have done their jobs. Of course there are some things that even the most finessed blurb can't save, but those generally have their own comedic value. Unfortunately, then reality sets in and I spend a lot of time trying to suss out which books truly deserve space on our shelves and which only sound good. I don't want to get suckered by the equivalent of the kick-ass trailer that was way better than the movie.<br /><br />Up first was Hachette, and today's big book was obvious--<a href="https://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/index.jhtml">Stephen Colbert's </a><em><strong>I Am America and So Can You</strong></em>, which will be coming out in October. But here are a few of the other things that caught my eye:<br /><br />Did you know that there are more Chinese restaurants in America than McDonald's, Burger Kings, and Wendy's combined? <em><strong>The Fortune Cookie Chronicles: Adventures in the World of Chinese Food</strong></em> by Jennifer 8 Lee looks so cool. I'm eager for the discussion of Jews and Chinese food--my mother was honestly very worried that she did something wrong as I disliked both Chinese food and chopped liver (Just so you know, I now have a proper love for the former though I still can't stand the latter). Unfortunately, I'll have to wait until MARCH for this to come out. Grumble.<br /><br />The fiction title that most intrigues me is <em><strong>Gods Behaving Badly</strong></em> by Marie Phillips, which takes the premise that the Greek gods are still with us, and living in a London townhouse. Little, Brown is describing it as <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9780140268867">Homer </a>meets <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780743298056">Jennifer Weiner</a>, which makes me a bit nervous. I'm hoping more for Rick Riordan's <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9780786838653">Percy Jackson</a> meets Curtis Sittenfeld's <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780812975390">Hannah Gavener</a>.   <br /><br />As for Alie, she is a girl who really knows her mysteries, and when I told her that Denise Mina's backlist was going to be reissued she was thrilled. So this will be the season of <a href="https://www.denisemina.co.uk/">Denise Mina</a>; starting in September her older books will be gussied up with pretty new covers and in February the paperback of <em><strong>The Dead Hour</strong></em> will be released as will her new hardcover, <em><strong>Slip of the Knife</strong></em>.  <br /><br />Up next? Simon and Schuster on Tuesday, and then on Wednesday I'm off to NYC for <a href="https://www.bookexpoamerica.com/App/homepage.cfm?moduleid=42&appname=288">BEA</a>--booksellers nirvana!
