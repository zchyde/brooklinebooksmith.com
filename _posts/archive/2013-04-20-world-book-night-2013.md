It makes the meaning of the forthcoming World Book Night highlighted all the more; when tough or scary things happen it's important to have anchors and reminders of our passions and the way we connect with our community and others outside ourselves to come together.<br /><br />April 23 is a special day for book lovers. It's Shakespeare's birthday, and the anniversary of both his death and the death of Miguel de Cervantes, the author of Don Quixote considered one of the earliest novels ever written. For many years UNESCO has named it International Day of the Book, and for the past few years the UK has celebrated by giving out free copies of cherished books to celebrate.<br /><br />For the 2nd year in a row the States are participating. Next Tuesday, the coordinated efforts of planners, readers, booksellers, publishers and UPS drivers will pay off when loads of literati hit the streets with a complimentary box of 25 copies of a title they've selected personally to give out to people who don't have access to books, or are even reluctant readers that just need a book pushed in their hands by an evangelist. I participated last year and this year am coordinating the Booksmith's efforts to get these books into the hands of those in our community who are ready and eager to spread the love of reading. We have a friendly and enthusiastic group of givers who have already begun to pick up their boxes of books! It's going to be an exciting night.<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4Zd2eNYsSK8/UXAfwSlcyLI/AAAAAAAABPE/4l_2Zlt-t5M/s1600/11a4b0e8a2e811e2a45222000a9e06f4_7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4Zd2eNYsSK8/UXAfwSlcyLI/AAAAAAAABPE/4l_2Zlt-t5M/s200/11a4b0e8a2e811e2a45222000a9e06f4_7.jpg" width="200" /></a><br />Furthermore, if you're a giver please join us and other givers at our <b>reception today, April 20th at 2:00 PM</b> in our Used Book Cellar so we can thank you for sharing the love with our community.<br /><br />For more about World Book Night, <a href="http://www.us.worldbooknight.org/">check out their website here</a>.
