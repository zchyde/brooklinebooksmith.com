The sound of the rain and wind and the general wet atmosphere is making me relax (yeah, I'm not from around here.&nbsp; I come from places where seeing the sun is a true rarity).&nbsp; What I really want to do right now is read Caroline Kennedy's new poetry collection, <em>Poems to Learn by Heart</em>, but alas, it is not due out until late&nbsp;March.&nbsp; So, later, I may just settle for the companion <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780786851119"><em>Family of Poems</em></a> -- this is one of the most beautiful collections of poetry I have ever come across. John Muth's illustrations are simply gorgeous.&nbsp; <br /><br />Unfortunetly, I can't&nbsp; read <em>Family </em>either, as&nbsp;being on the clock means I can't curl up and read.&nbsp; But I can demo games (if you ever want to see one of our games open and in action please don't hesitate to ask).&nbsp; I decided to open up one of our brand new games: "<a href="https://www.thinkfun.com/swish">Swish</a>."<br /><br />It's really hard!&nbsp; And fun. The cards are transparent with various dots and hoops (together they are called swishes, though they&nbsp;look like eyes).&nbsp; 16 of these cards are laid out and you must match the hoops with the dots -- none can be left out.&nbsp; The challenge is you aren't allowed to touch the cards until you see the "swishes."&nbsp; It's a great solitaire and group game that can be tucked away in its carrying mesh case for travel.<br /><br />Apparently this game is supposed to improve your spatial IQ, but I&nbsp;just think it's cool.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Gp0g1KXQEAs/Tp85z43KT5I/AAAAAAAAARQ/Z0UAAQ1HiJs/s1600/untitled.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Gp0g1KXQEAs/Tp85z43KT5I/AAAAAAAAARQ/Z0UAAQ1HiJs/s1600/untitled.png" /></a></div>
