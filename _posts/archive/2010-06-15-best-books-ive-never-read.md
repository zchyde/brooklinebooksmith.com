A few days ago, after I finished yet another so-so novel, I complained to my English professor boyfriend about the mediocrity of most fiction. "Read <i><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780486280509">Portrait of the Artist</a></i>!" he advised for the ten thousandth time. I suspect that if I don't read it soon, he'll start thwocking me over the head with it any time I complain about anything I'm reading. He bought me a copy and knows where it is at all times so he can foist it on me.<div><br />I've never read Joyce (except the parts of <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780486268705"><i>Dubliners </i></a>I had to read as an undergrad). But that's not all I haven't read!
