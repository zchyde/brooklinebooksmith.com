I don't have much in the way of interesting blogging today other than to say that i've been reading, re-reading, going to sleep, waking up, and re-re-reading Norman Lock's <i>Grim Tales</i><br /><font size="1"><br /><ul><br />The steamer appeared in the harbor at dusk, black smoke from its stacks losing itself in the coming darkness. As the boat drew closer to the wharf, men leaning against the bollards to smoke heard band music on the water: "The Mountains of the Moon," a tune none had heard until then, which seemed to dissolve in the suddenly chill air. Night fell; the ship's lights trembled against the black river. Here and there, passengers could be seen standing in the light that splashed down onto the decks. The men on the pier had never seen such a ship. It came to rest, gangplanks were let down, and now the passengers began their slow disembarkation. They wore clothes the men thought peculiar -- clothes that had been fashionable in 1912 when the Titanic is believed to have gone down. But the name of this ship was H.M.S. Titanic; and later, when the passengers were questioned, they laughed at the idea their ship had sunk! Didn't we know it is "unsinkable"? There had been ice in the sea lanes and thick fog -- they remembered the fog; but they had slept soundly that night and long -- dreaming, in first class or steerage, of ballrooms or barrooms, polo or bocce. The best sleep of our lives! they said while they waited with letters in their hands for those who had promised to meet them."</ul></font><br /><br />You can read the whole piece over at the elimae website | <a href="https://www.elimae.com/ebooks/lock/tales.html">H E R E</a>
