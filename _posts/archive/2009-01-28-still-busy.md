So far I've bought from Dover, Perseus, University of Chicago (and other university presses it distributes), Simon &amp; <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Schuster</span>, Candlewick, and <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">HarperCollins</span> kids. Whew! I do hope I'll figure out a good way to preview some of my favorites from all of them. During the next few busy weeks I'll try to keep updating with some of the new recommendations from fellow <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Booksmith</span> staffers.
