So, if you're someone who loves games, but lives in a place where no one else does,&nbsp;it's just sad to see great games just sitting to collect dust.&nbsp; But, having all solitaire-like games....boring.&nbsp; That's why Katamino is great.&nbsp; It's mainly a one player rendition of Tetris with hundreds of variations to accomplish.&nbsp; However, the board can&nbsp;convert into a two player race.&nbsp; Who will use their blocks to fill their side of the board first?<br /><br />So, the video below makes it look way too easy; and, at first Katamino&nbsp;is, but when the bar moves to higher numbers, it does get quite boggling.&nbsp; Plus, they make&nbsp;great building blocks to make funky creatures and buildings.<br /><br />Why Katamino?&nbsp; At&nbsp;times, you just need to focus on problem solving with your own head and hands, rather than solely on teamwork ethic.<br /><div class="separator" style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://2.gvt0.com/vi/W0luMnybKB4/0.jpg"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/W0luMnybKB4&fs=1&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><embed width="320" height="266" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/W0luMnybKB4&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed></object></div>
