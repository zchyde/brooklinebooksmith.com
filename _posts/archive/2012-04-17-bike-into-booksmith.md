When, thirty minutes after leaving the store,&nbsp;I exited the T station nearest my apartment and began stumbling up the block toward home, I was waved down by two exuberant bikers flying toward me. <br /><br />I recognized the hunched, slightly sweaty forms of two of my co-workers,&nbsp;to whom I had said goodnight thirty minutes prior. As they wheeled merrily on their way, I trudged onward toward my apartment, through the door, and past my out-of-commission bike with a flat back wheel. As soon as&nbsp;my flat is&nbsp;fixed I'll be&nbsp;whizzing around Boston in a summer free from the hassle and trial of public transportation. <br /><br /><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HdeUhA5t6ds/T4s9HmTWjsI/AAAAAAAAAbk/S_qTQNDZD-Y/s1600/9781598800265.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HdeUhA5t6ds/T4s9HmTWjsI/AAAAAAAAAbk/S_qTQNDZD-Y/s200/9781598800265.jpg" width="128" /></a><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kYK2fk-tves/T4s8tWCRUkI/AAAAAAAAAbc/vNKFi4OKNFI/s1600/614981559510.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kYK2fk-tves/T4s8tWCRUkI/AAAAAAAAAbc/vNKFi4OKNFI/s200/614981559510.jpg" width="129" /></a>At Booksmith we have all&nbsp;the resources you need--short of fixing a flat--to prepare for a summer of biking around the state.
