I've played around with a few e-reader devices, and I must say they are not for me.&nbsp; It was no shocker, really.&nbsp; I like feeling the book and seeing how far its come and how much is left.&nbsp; Plus it's weird -- weirder&nbsp;than I anticipated --&nbsp;&nbsp;to read little tiny letters on a condensed page on a screen.&nbsp; But I did give it a try (if you are the e-reader type please <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/gbook/help/about">click here</a> for a variety of titles to peruse for your little book-on-a-screen).&nbsp; Reading without an e-reader is worth finding new creative ways to shelf my books on a limited budget.&nbsp; And carrying them around, too.<br /><br />While we are on the subject, a while ago, one of our booksellers brought this to my attention: <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--TNLb4rYedc/Te_iM7b3ZBI/AAAAAAAAAP4/rVnUiBLIbfU/s1600/nook.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="241" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--TNLb4rYedc/Te_iM7b3ZBI/AAAAAAAAAP4/rVnUiBLIbfU/s320/nook.png" t8="true" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish by Dr. Seuss</td></tr></tbody></table><br />"But a Nook can't read."&nbsp; So, what do you have to say about that?&nbsp; Poor (B&amp;N) Nook.
