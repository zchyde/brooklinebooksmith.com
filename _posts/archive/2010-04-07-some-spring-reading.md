I’m so glad it’s spring now, aren’t you?  <br /><br />Right before the onset of spring, I had the pleasure of rereading E.B. White’s<span style="font-style:italic;"> Trumpet of the Swan</span>.  There’s nothing like reading a nature story -- that takes place in the wilds of Canada -- outdoors while surrounded by some very vocal mallards, green tipped trees, and birds singing over a pond reflecting a blue sky.  And, in Brookline, where no real mountains or forests without noise pollution are readily accessible, I like to settle for Hall’s Pond – off Amory St, less than ten minutes from the Booksmith.  Some people prefer cafes and books, but reading outdoors does have its merits no matter what the temperature is (yes, I admit to reading outside in 10˚ weather and thoroughly enjoying it).  Anyway, I soon realized some other prominent themes in E.B. White’s classic that I had long since forgotten.  The main one is that every boy needs to read <span style="font-style:italic;">The Trumpet of the Swan</span>; or, why Louis is a great role model.<br /><br />Louis:<br />•Knows and appreciates the power of literacy<br />•Knows there is more to communication than verbal words alone<br />•Pays off his debts<br />•Stands up for what he believes in<br />•Materialism only extends to his needs<br />•Is a hero<br />•Committed to his girl, jobs, and his promises<br />•Has a fabulous taste in music, not to mention his own trumpeting skills<br />•Knows that living a sheltered, captive life is no life at all<br />•(and, did you know Louis used to live the Boston Public Garden -- well, okay, in the book?  He’s a local!)
