"Look! Isn't this gorgeous? GAAAAAAAAH!" (Possibly not her exact words, but a reasonable approximation, as anyone who's seen Clarissa get excited about a book can attest.) (Now it has a Caldecott Honor.)<br /><br /><table id="aba-search-results-table"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><div class="abaproduct-image"></div></td><td><div class="abaproduct-details"><div class="abaproduct-title"><h2>&nbsp;</h2></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/v/9781416963981" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="https://images.booksense.com/images/books/981/963/FC9781416963981.JPG" title="Doll Bones" /></a>When <i>Doll Bones</i>&nbsp;came in, longtime Holly Black fan Amy wrote a recommendation and started handselling. If the sales figures are any indication, she's helped the book reach quite a few of Brookline's young readers. (Now it has a Newbery Honor.)<br /><br /><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/v/9780763660406" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img src="https://images.booksense.com/images/books/406/660/FC9780763660406.JPG" title="Flora and Ulysses: The Illuminated Adventures" /></a><br /><br />When <i>Flora and Ulysses </i>came in, I had every intention of popularizing the phrase "holy unanticipated occurrences!" That didn't really happen, but I did have fun selling the book. (Now it has&nbsp;the Newbery Medal.)<br /><br /><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/v/9781416994152" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="https://images.booksense.com/images/books/152/994/FC9781416994152.JPG" title="Locomotive" /></a><br /><br />When <i>Locomotive</i>&nbsp;came in, Paul was all, "I love that book!" I imagine that his kids were, too. (Now it has the Caldecott Medal.)<br /><br /><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/v/9780307931900" style="background-color: #eeeeee; clear: left; color: #4b5cc3; float: left; font-family: 'Helvetica neue', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-decoration: none;"><img src="https://images.booksense.com/images/books/900/931/FC9780307931900.JPG" style="border: 0px;" title="Two Boys Kissing" /></a><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/v/9781250012579" style="background-color: #eeeeee; clear: right; color: #4b5cc3; float: right; font-family: 'Helvetica neue', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; text-align: center; text-decoration: none;"><img src="https://images.booksense.com/images/books/579/012/FC9781250012579.JPG" style="border: 0px;" title="Eleanor &amp; Park" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />When a gaggle of YA authors including Rainbow Rowell and David Levithan came to the store, a gaggle of <em>us</em>&nbsp;- the kids' team plus Kat plus Anna plus possibly whoever I'm forgetting - not only stayed for the event, we waited until the loooong signing line was gone so we could get our own books signed, chat with the authors, and sample the pumpkin mocha breve muffins one fan had left for Rainbow. (Now <em>Eleanor and Park</em> has a Printz Honor, and <em>Two Boys Kissing </em>has a Stonewall Honor.)<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><br /><a href="https://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2014/01/american-library-association-announces-2014-youth-media-award-winners">The full list of winners, announced last Monday, is here</a>. There were less familiar&nbsp;books that went immediately onto our to-read lists, and there were books left off that we'll lovingly recommend anyway. (Like <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780803738553">this one</a>.) But it's nice to be able to brag a little: we (and, in many cases, our customers) liked these books before they were cool.
