We are officially at the top of the pain roller coaster referred to as the "holidays". The time of year when you get real close with your therapist, revisit old addictions, cry, go deeply into debt and resolve to fix the aforementioned hullabaloo. I want none of it this year. This year I am going to do this thing differently. This is the year ,as Dr. Oz would say, "the year of self-care". I am going to make a menu of ways to avoid the fevered hell that is late November to mid February.<br /><br /><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TNb6U4Wwi6I/AAAAAAAAAJ4/Oze0GAmd_1I/s1600/sketchysanta11.jpg"><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 230px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 234px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5536888028530772898" border="0" alt="" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TNb6U4Wwi6I/AAAAAAAAAJ4/Oze0GAmd_1I/s400/sketchysanta11.jpg" /></a> <em><strong>Gift reduction.</strong></em><br /><br />Everyone on my list is getting a used or discount book. (you're welcome)<br />If you are on my list and lucky I may make you some neat-<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">erific</span> infused gin thing, it's cheap and useful.<br /><br /><strong><em>Relaxation.</em></strong><br /><strong><em></em></strong><br />I am going to work long and weird hours avoiding family functions. (soothing)<br /><br /><strong><em>Serenity.</em></strong><br /><strong><em></em></strong><br />I am going to start weight lifting, and dropping the weights, and grunting. OR. I am going to take up sewing.<br /><br /><strong><em>Celebration.</em></strong><br /><strong><em></em></strong><br />I am going to use lotion this winter. I will spend too long at <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">CVS</span> deciding between Dove and <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Olay</span>. I am going to use my extra care bucks. (p-a-r-t-y-t-o-w-n)<br /><br />I am going to see Amy <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">Sedaris</span>...and learn more poor people crafting techniques.<br /><br /><strong><em>Acceptance.</em></strong><br /><strong><em></em></strong><br />I am going to enjoy Turkey Day. (yes I know what we did to the indigenous peoples of this continent, but you can't take this one shrapnel of joy from me today.)<br /><br />I'm going to go to my brother's house, teach the kids to whittle and swear. Then, I shall eat and drink too much. I will arise the next morn and purge it out during a "5k turkey trot of contrition."<br /><br />Let us be strong together. We can get through this. I know we can.<br /><br />Just give the gift of cheap books...(and maybe some infused gin)<br /><br />that's what the holidays are about. new ideas. and forgetting them.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TNb4p_qHBpI/AAAAAAAAAJo/62IGzwAeZ_g/s1600/book..bmp"><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 221px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 166px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5536886192244983442" border="0" alt="" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TNb4p_qHBpI/AAAAAAAAAJo/62IGzwAeZ_g/s400/book..bmp" /></a></div>
