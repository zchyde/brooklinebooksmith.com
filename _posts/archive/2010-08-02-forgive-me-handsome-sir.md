As any red blooded American coward would do I weaseled over his way to feign shelving for that section. When I looked over his shoulder, I saw that he was reading from a Nook. You know, B&amp;N's answer to the kindle. My heart skipped a beat and I thought to myself...."why is it always the pretty ones?" nah-- what I really thought was..."say something say something!" so I said something. This is how the conversation unfolded.</div><br /><br /><div></div><br /><br /><div><strong>me-</strong> <em>Oh hi!</em> (bats eyelashes a little too ardently) <em>are you browsing from our aisles and buying from them? </em>(chin pointing to his device since hands are holding 60lbs of books)</div><br /><br /><div></div><br /><br /><div><strong>handsome-</strong> <em>uh, </em>(long uncomfortable pause<em>)</em> <em>I guess so...</em></div><br /><br /><div><em></em></div><br /><br /><div><strong>me- </strong><em>so the thing is, we want you here and all, but if you don't buy from us it'll be hard to provide you with this browsing opportunity you seem to be getting a lot out of...</em></div><br /><br /><div></div><br /><br /><div>(ok I didn't say that)</div><br /><br /><div><em></em></div><br /><br /><div>I really said...</div><br /><br /><div><em></em></div><br /><br /><div><em>"if you only buy from them-- stores like this could go away"</em></div><br /><br /><div><em></em></div><br /><br /><div><strong>handsome- </strong>(nods head a bit too rapidly, smiles (sigh)) and says --</div><br /><br /><div></div><br /><br /><div><em>yea, I know</em></div><br /><br /><div><em></em></div><br /><br /><div>And so I waited till he went downstairs (to presumably get away from me...) before I shuffled over to Paul to recount the affair (in 3 minutes or less Dana I swear)</div><br /><br /><div></div><br /><br /><div>Progress is good. Change is good. Technology is good. </div><br /><br /><div></div><br /><br /><div>Awareness is great.</div><br /><br /><div></div><br /><br /><div>Being aware of the people around you, how they are surviving, how they buy their food, keep themselves clothed---these are the details that matter....how we live. Your money is your vote.</div><br /><br /><div></div><br /><br /><div>thanks for your support.</div><br /><br /><div></div><br /><br /><div>(I promise my next post will be less commerce-y)</div>
