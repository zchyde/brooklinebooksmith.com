Hello, this is Katie, bookseller, events wrangler, flyer-maker, veg cookbook fanatic.<div><br /></div><div>Soon we will get this thing back up and running for real, but probably not 'til after the holidays.</div><div><br /></div><div>For now, please visit us on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/booksmithtweets">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/brooklinebooksmith">Facebook</a>. They are some of the best ways to stay up-to-date with the event series and other store happenings as they are happening. Like, when I was startled at the Boston Book Fest by a life-sized Clifford, or when gossips broke celebrity event news (<a href="http://entertainmentrealm.com/">ahem AMY</a>), or the moment a child declared us "the Las Vegas of Brookline."</div><div><br /></div><div>And join our weekly email list, <a href="http://brooklinebooksmith.com/">B-Mail</a>. Do it.</div>
