riding in the 66 for more than a decade now.<br />it's an illuminating stretch of my commute. the 39 is all students,<br />or nurses, going down towards the center of town.<br />but the 66, from Dudley to Harvard, is another thing entirely.<br />Dudley Square, Harvard Square, Coolidge Corner; for these names we all have some image in our mind. And the 66 is most often where they meet,<br />and where we can all compare our image with what we experience.<br /><br />Willingness to pay attention and step aside when someone needs to depart<br />How much space do you take in a seat meant for two<br />Charitableness of spirit<br />Attitude<br />Wealth<br />Age<br />Race<br /><br />color is last on the list, because i put it there a while ago.<br />i came to the city from a not terribly prosperous and predominantly white Connecticut town. city life quickly exposed to me that i had some preconceptions about race. they were of the charitable but naive variety, and as i started to understand the people around me the question of skin color slid down to the bottom of the list of things that i needed to worry about.<br /><br />the 66 gives me a fresh lesson 4 days a week.<br />sit on the bus for ten minutes and, if i'm paying attention and thinking about the people that i see getting on and off, i can review and revise my assumptions about race, age, wealth, homelessness, poverty, child-rearing, health, local government, national government, crime, policing, public life, private life,<br /><br />you know, all the stuff that we need to figure out in America.<br /><br /><br /><br />if you don't take the 66, at least come and take a look out the real time virtual window to Dudley Square on the street outside our store. the idea has potential, but the fulfillment depends on you.
