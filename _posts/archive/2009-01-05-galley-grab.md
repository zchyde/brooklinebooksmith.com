Up for grabs today is <strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780060590314">Fool</a></em></strong>, the new novel by Christopher Moore that goes on sale February 10th.<br /><br />It comes wrapped in brown paper that proclaims: "WARNING! THIS IS A BAWDY TALE. Herein YOU WILL FIND GRATUITOUS SHAGGING, MURDER, SPANKING, MAIMING, TREASON, and heretofore UNEXPLORED HEIGHTS OF VULGARITY and PROFANITY, as well as NON-TRADITIONAL GRAMMAR, SPLIT INFINITIVES, and THE ODD WANK. If that sort of thing bothers you, then gentle reader pass by, for we endeavor only to entertain, not to offend. That said, if that's the sort of thing you think you might enjoy, then you have happened upon THE PERFECT STORY!"<br /><br />I think that pretty much says it all. Well, not quite. If you want to find out what it's actually <em>about</em> you can click on the title above which will go to a fuller description.<br /><br />Want it? Leave a comment with your name and I'll put one on hold for you. Right now I only have one but I may be able to find another (sans plain brown paper wrapper) if there is demand.
