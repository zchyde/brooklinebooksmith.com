One of the most common statements I hear is that "there are so many books, how do I know what to read next [or give my child to read]?"&nbsp; I quite agree.&nbsp; There's so much out there with varying content levels.&nbsp; Great writing.&nbsp; Poor writing.&nbsp; Interesting reads.&nbsp; Thought provoking picturebooks.&nbsp; Please-don't-waste-your-time-with-this-here-book kind of reads.&nbsp; Fantastic novels that are a great for a sixteen-year-old, but&nbsp;would, er, not&nbsp;be so great for a&nbsp;ten-year-old...&nbsp; <br /><br />While we are always eager to find the perfect book to place into your hands -- or for a loved one -- I recommend <a href="https://childrensbookalmanac.com/">this here</a> website.&nbsp; Anita Silvey knows the ins and outs of children's publishing.&nbsp; As a a matter of fact, she was the original editor for the Curious George books.&nbsp; In <em>Children's Book-A-Day Almanac</em>, Silvey explores notable children's books for all ages, both classic and contemporary.&nbsp; It is a great way to build your reading list.&nbsp; Do you know the best part?&nbsp; With every book that is published there is, of course, a story behind the story and how it came to be published.&nbsp; Anita's wealth of knowledge&nbsp;for thousands of children's books is revealed.&nbsp; Everyday there is something new to be learned.<br /><br /><blockquote><div class="tagline" style="text-align: center;">"Daily children’s book recommendations and events from Anita Silvey.</div><div class="tagline" style="text-align: center;">Discover the stories behind the children’s book classics . . .</div><div class="tagline" style="text-align: center;">The new books on their way to becoming classics . . .</div><div class="tagline" style="text-align: center;">And events from the world of children’s books—and the world at large."</div></blockquote>
