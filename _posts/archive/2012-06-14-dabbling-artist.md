<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br /><div style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;">"Books, albums, they're the same. People create things." -Patti Smith</div><div style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;"><br /></div>Patti Smith said the above last week in New York at BookExpo America (BEA) while interviewing Neil Young about his memoir, which is due out this fall. (<em>The New Yorker</em> blogged about the interview <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2012/06/neil-young-and-patti-smith.html#ixzz1xVUAL91N" target="_blank">here</a>; our own Jodie, in her elegant Jodie way, managed to encapsulate the craziness of BEA into a beautifully written blog post <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith.blogspot.com/2012/06/dispatch-from-book-expo-america-or.html" target="_blank">here</a>).<br /><br /><div style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZYgrMfMrZYw/T9o46rwKAzI/AAAAAAAANcA/drCh6L8s4PY/s1600/just+kids.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; cssfloat: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" pca="true" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZYgrMfMrZYw/T9o46rwKAzI/AAAAAAAANcA/drCh6L8s4PY/s200/just+kids.jpg" width="132" /></a>Coincidentally, I happen to be reading Patti Smith's memoir, <em><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/%5Bmodel%5D-117" target="_blank">Just Kids</a></em>. Nearly two years after it's been a bestseller, I picked it up because the instructor in my photography class showed us Robert Mapplethorpe's orchid images and mentioned the book. I had seen it so many times, on our Books We Love table, on our best sellers shelf, but it wasn't until then that I really knew what it was about: two artists trying to make it.&nbsp; </div><div style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;"><br /></div><div style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;">There are many reasons why <em>Just Kids</em> is appealing, not the least the core of the book, the relationship between Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe. It was a relationship made complicated by Robert's attraction to men, but also one that was remarkably simple because it revolved around a mutual respect for each other's work and careers. However what I found most&nbsp;compelling about their lives is how Patti and Robert explored so many art forms. Patti Smith was into drawing and wrote music reviews for magazines before becoming the poet and musician that we know her for today; Robert Mapplethorpe actually resisted photography because it was an expensive medium to work with, and instead made necklaces, created installations, and drew.</div><div style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;"><br /></div><div style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;">I related to this exploration of many art forms, being somewhat of a dabbler myself. In graduate school, while pursuing my degree in creative writing, I took classes in literary nonfiction, screenwriting, column writing, and even wrote film reviews for the school newspaper, while chipping away at my novel. This summer, I decided to formally learn photography, something I've been fiddling around with for as long as I can remember. It was inspiring to see that these two greats in their own fields played with&nbsp;other forms of artistic expression, and&nbsp;that maybe, it&nbsp;even enhanced their eventual careers.</div><div style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;"><br /></div><div style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;">In that vein, here are some books that speak to the dabbling artist, young or old, or anyone with the least bit of artistic sensibility, looking for some inspiration. <br /><br /><div style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8PVtSUNoBAE/T9pAFTZMs9I/AAAAAAAANdE/S_hIujZ9YnY/s1600/steal.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; cssfloat: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" pca="true" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8PVtSUNoBAE/T9pAFTZMs9I/AAAAAAAANdE/S_hIujZ9YnY/s1600/steal.jpg" /></a><strong><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780761169253" target="_blank"><em>Steal Like An Artist</em> by Austin Kleon</a></strong> - This miniature book is structured around a list of ten pieces of advice about being creative.
