For my first blog post, I was going to tell you about starting my day by flipping through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316200905" target="_blank">My Ideal Bookshelf</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781451661613" target="_blank">ZooBorns the Next Generation</a>&nbsp;(in my head, ZooBorns TNG), and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781579129101" target="_blank">My Bookstore</a>, but then the following occurred:<br /><br /><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2RMWq9Iqc_c/UKPY8rhoGGI/AAAAAAAAAF0/-jevfiOYKUE/s1600/blog_newfather.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2RMWq9Iqc_c/UKPY8rhoGGI/AAAAAAAAAF0/-jevfiOYKUE/s1600/blog_newfather.jpg" /></a>A man rushed into the bookstore, and within five minutes he was up at the register with a book in hand. He gave me&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780789208156" target="_blank">The New Father</a>&nbsp;by Armin Brott. &nbsp;I looked at his wrist and saw a plastic ID bracelet decorated with teddy bears and ducks, and realized what this all was. I asked if he had come straight from the hospital, which he had, and if it was a boy or a girl. &nbsp;It was a boy, and I congratulated him. He was clearly elated and excited, and he flew out of the bookstore as quickly as he had come in. <br /><br />I want to put this out there, in case he ever stumbles upon this blog: I'm glad we were here to offer you the right book for your growing family, and I hope we get to see your baby as he grows up. &nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulations again, and thank you for reminding me about my favorite part of bookselling: connecting the right person to the right book and knowing they're about to have a lovely future with one another.
