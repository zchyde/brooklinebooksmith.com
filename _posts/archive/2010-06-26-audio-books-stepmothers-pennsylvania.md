I am doing this because I have grown fond of a fella, and that is where his family lives...I'm looking forward to 3 days of careful self- censorship as I try and remember not to swear, burp or make any crass religious jokes.<img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 185px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 222px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5487112244390424098" border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TCYjg6mWbiI/AAAAAAAAAFA/16GWSRSRLPc/s320/amish.jpg" /></div><div>I tend to get very nauseous whilst driving, so I think<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TCYivhkop8I/AAAAAAAAAEo/Qx3J1ykmUNg/s1600/901e6e547a87943f_step-by-step.jpg"><img style="MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; WIDTH: 174px; FLOAT: left; HEIGHT: 230px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5487111395858753474" border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TCYivhkop8I/AAAAAAAAAEo/Qx3J1ykmUNg/s320/901e6e547a87943f_step-by-step.jpg" /></a> we are going to try an audio book---which I haven't experienced since I was 12 in the backseat of my 3rd stepmother's van, being carted off to her home in ALABAMA where I was paid $50 to pack up her things and move her to Rhode Island. The book we listened to was <em>Pigs in Heaven</em> by Barbara Kingsolver <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780060922535">http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780060922535</a><br /></div><div>I loved the book and it really was quite successful in helping me dissociate from the saccharine drawl of a woman who put many wonderful books in my hand, and ulcers in my stomach.I think I'll probably go with one of our many language books and try and learn Italian...that way I can continue to swear --mostly undetected.<img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 140px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 237px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5487111824395212034" border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TCYjId_sFQI/AAAAAAAAAEw/v5SETc6783M/s320/pigs-in-heaven.jpg" /></div></div></div></div>
