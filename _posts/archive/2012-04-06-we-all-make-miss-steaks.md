Also, we got new lights downstairs. I'll tell you what! It's like daylight down in our lil cave, you should come check it out. I didn't realize before that Carl wears different colors of flannel! Also, the lights are so bright (in a good way) that all the different colored spines of the books look like CANDY. It's good times.<br /><br />When I'm left to my own devices in the UBC I do silly things like pass on first edition <i>Don Quixotes</i> and buy books that I later realize have highlighting in them. D'oh! (We also don't buy back books from our dollar cart but I didn't make that misteak last weak.) The book I bought that ended up having highlighting in it was&nbsp;<i>ADD-Friendly Ways to Organize Your Life.&nbsp;</i>I might need a copy<i>.</i><br /><i><br /></i><br />So come check out all the pretty books in the pretty lights and see what weird stuff I bought while Carl was on vacation! Tons of old <i>Grantas</i>! Cool art books! Fiction that'll blow your mind!<br /><br />Okay, thanks for reading!<br /><br /><br />...<br /><br /><br />!!!!!
