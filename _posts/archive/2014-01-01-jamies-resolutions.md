While I'm not a fan of New Year's resolutions as I break them immediately, I'm making a few of my own this year that I promise to keep.<br /><br /><u>JAMIE'S NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS</u><br />1. Continue with my occasional habit of reading so far into the night that I fall asleep with a book on my face and wake up at 4am with the lights on<br />2. Continue using receipts, pay stubs, and financial documents as bookmarks so when tax time comes around I can cobble together my finances by recalling which book I was reading and when<br />3. Continue gathering books on my nightstand like a fiend, as my tottering and ever fluctuating bedside pile is a great place to remember where I put my iPad super safely<br />4. Continue using other books to weigh down the book I'm reading while I'm eating breakfast and another book to prop it up slightly<br />5. Continue purchasing giant over-sized books and bookshelves to house the giant over-sized books I acquired and then smaller books to fill in the shelves the over-sized books cannot fit in<br /><br />and most importantly:<br /><br />6. Continue being unaware of my somewhat questionable habits and blissfully read into 2014<br /><br />Happy New Year!
