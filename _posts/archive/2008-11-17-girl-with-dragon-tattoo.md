I found out via <a href="https://www.aintitcool.com/node/39093">Ain't It Cool News </a>that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stieg_Larsson">Steig Larsson</a>'s amazing mystery <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780307269751"><strong><em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em></strong> </a>has been made into a movie in Sweden. Based on these <a href="https://twitchfilm.net/site/view/two-teasers-from-danish-cyber-thriller-man-som-hatar-kvinnor-the-girl-with-/">previews </a>I would totally line up for that one. I'm also impatiently lining up for the sequel, <em><strong><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780307269980">The Girl Who Played With Fire</a>,</strong></em> which will be coming out next August, which now seems entirely too far away.
