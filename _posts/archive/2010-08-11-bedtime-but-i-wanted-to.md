Life is full of interruptions.  Guess what?  So are some books.<br /><br />Check out these new picturebook titles released just this week:<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780670011407">Read to Tiger</a> by S.J. Fore and illustrated by R.W. Alley</span><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TGPf6nSzhAI/AAAAAAAAAH4/t7J_TP2BNWk/s1600/9780670011407.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 249px; height: 320px;" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TGPf6nSzhAI/AAAAAAAAAH4/t7J_TP2BNWk/s320/9780670011407.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5504489367650141186" border="0" /></a><br /><br />How can this boy ever finish his book with a tiger who practices his karate, dresses up like a bear, and rides a train around the couch?  It's one interruption after another.<br /><br />The first time I read this book, I could not contain my laughter!   The antics of this playful tiger and this boy's determination to finish his book is too good to pass up.<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763641689">Interrupting Chicken</a> by David Ezra Stein</span><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TGPgE8r9mJI/AAAAAAAAAIA/X8diZ_kYId4/s1600/9780763641689.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 263px;" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TGPgE8r9mJI/AAAAAAAAAIA/X8diZ_kYId4/s320/9780763641689.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5504489545191495826" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><br />Little Red Chicken knows his bedtime stories so well that he keeps interrupting his father.  It's not to be rude or anything, but he believes he's saving the characters -- like Little Red Riding Hood and Chicken Little -- from dangers that lay ahead.  But, will this chicken ever go to sleep?  After all, he "can't go to sleep without a story!"
