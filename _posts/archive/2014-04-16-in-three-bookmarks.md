After lugging my borrowed copy through four countries, I finally finished <i>The Goldfinch</i>&nbsp;just in time for its Pulitzer Prize win. I borrowed it from Lydia, who borrowed it from Natasha, who had grabbed a galley copy of the book over a year ago. It has been loved, very, <i>very </i>loved, with three bookmarks, unintentionally bent pages and all.<br /><br /><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pGjcKpm9omQ/U010gecsHiI/AAAAAAAACqs/SC6LFJSS0hE/s1600/blog1.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pGjcKpm9omQ/U010gecsHiI/AAAAAAAACqs/SC6LFJSS0hE/s1600/blog1.JPG" height="240" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PN8gD4vD69c/U010hm5BM_I/AAAAAAAACq0/RFPHLceiSoI/s1600/blog2.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PN8gD4vD69c/U010hm5BM_I/AAAAAAAACq0/RFPHLceiSoI/s1600/blog2.JPG" height="130" width="200" /></a>Bookmark #1<br /><br />When I was in Boston Logan waiting for my first of (too) many flights, I opened the book and discovered this bookmark on page 37, holding Lydia's page. It was made by the insanely talented Julia while she had a broken arm, and I'm not surprised that while wobbly, the entire image is legible! I'm happy to say Julia is completely healed (yes, it took me that long to finish this book) and is in tip top shape. I used it for my bookmark for a little bit, until I realized that meant Lydia would be at a loss when I returned the book.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SLtkdaY-5cY/U010kRZs4UI/AAAAAAAACrE/fxz03jvVukw/s1600/blog4.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SLtkdaY-5cY/U010kRZs4UI/AAAAAAAACrE/fxz03jvVukw/s1600/blog4.JPG" height="320" width="259" /></a>Bookmark #2<br /><br />I have to go to bookstores wherever I go. In Jakarta, I was attempting to navigate a mall with a friend and extremely limited knowledge of Bahasa (<i>terima kasih!</i>) when we happened upon a machine next to the mall directory. After using the touch screen to type out 'book,' out came this slip with very careful directions to the closest bookstore. &nbsp;I don't think I've ever been so happy to see a touch screen in my life. This slip of paper made me so delighted, and in my desire to keep it forever I put it in the safest place I knew--the book I was currently reading.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pjNiCchjdkY/U010jDig9UI/AAAAAAAACq8/aftfingiiac/s1600/blog3.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pjNiCchjdkY/U010jDig9UI/AAAAAAAACq8/aftfingiiac/s1600/blog3.JPG" height="320" width="156" /></a>Bookmark #3<br /><br />Once I had gotten back to Boston, I put <i>The Goldfinch</i>&nbsp;on my kitchen table in an attempt to read it during breakfast. Almost immediately my roommate noticed and mentioned that she wanted to read it, so we started reading it in tandem. It was fun to see our respective bookmarks jump ahead bit by bit.<br /><br />My roommate's bookmark of choice is a Brookline Booksmith bookmark (of course), continually supplied by me.<br /><br /><br />I'm glad to part from it. I have held this book in my hands, used it as a pillow among a sea of airport sleepers, been furious at myself for carrying a four-pound book with me when I am notorious for going over my luggage weight--in short, spent more than enough time with it. <i>The Goldfinch</i>&nbsp;is now safely nestled in Lydia's box, sans duct tape, ready to be read again.<br /><br /><br /></div>
