We've gotten some awfully great press lately and I just wanted to share how exciting it is to everyone here. We think we're awfully cool (well, I'm not so cool, but the store is!), so it's nifty when others agree! Read on...<br /><br />** April's <a href="http://www.bostonmagazine.com/index.html"><em>Boston</em> </a>magazine lists "The 61 New Best Things About Boston." Coming it at #36 is the poet <a href="http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/bostonpride/page4">Charles Coe</a>, who kindly tips his hat to <a href="http://brooklinebooksmith.com/">Brookline Booksmith </a>and <a href="http://www.mcintyreandmoore.com/">McIntyre and Moore </a>as two of the best things in Boston. Thanks Mr. Coe!<br /><br />**April's <em><a href="http://www.lolaboston.com/">Lola </a></em>magazine features Hannah Richards, founder of <a href="http://thecoloredpencilproject.org/index.html">The Colored Pencil Project</a>. They asked her to list the ten things in Boston she can't live without. Number one? Killing time at Brookine Booksmith! Ms. Richards made our day when she said "I love everything about it--the creaky floors [note--glad someone likes 'em...], the sales in front, the staff." Aww, thanks. We love you too!<br /><br />**<a href="http://www.boston.com/">Boston.com</a> listed "25 Things to Do in Boston for Under $25" and coming in at #13 is <a href="http://www.boston.com/travel/boston/gallery/25_under_25_spring?pg=13">attend a book reading</a> at the <a href="http://brooklinebooksmith.com/Events/MainEvent.html">Booksmith </a>or the <a href="http://harvard.com/">Harvard Book Store</a>, our friends across the river. Cool!<br /><br />**And last, but not least, just as <a href="http://brooklinebooksmith.blogspot.com/2008/03/alies-pick-make-big-time.html">Alie </a>was recently featured in the Boston Globe's Book Reviews for her "Pick of the Week," this past Sunday was Dana's turn in the sun. She recommended <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781565125698"><strong><em>Mudbound</em></strong> </a>by Hillary Jordan. You can read what she said <a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2008/03/30/compleat_angler?mode=PF">here </a>(just scroll to the bottom).<br /><br />Not too shabby, my friends, not too shabby. (By the way, I'm grinning like a fool.)
