I'm here posting a quick note to gloat over the fact that I'm here and you're not (unless you're at the computer terminal behind me...). There are more authors than you could ever hope to meet in a weekend and more books than you can ever hope to read in a lifetime.<br /><br />So far I've been able to accomplish a few of my missions--I got a copy of <em>Plenty</em> (yippee!) and of <em>Silent in the Sanctuary</em> (double yippee! I should say hello to Ms. Raybourn's husband, who has apparently found his way here and warned her I was on the lookout for her...but not in a stalkerish way). I have to thank a good friend for getting me Kathryn Caskie's <em>How to Engage an Earl</em>--I ran to her signing table after my meeting to find that all she had left was her previous title, <em>How to Seduce a Duke</em>. Thanks Kari!<br /><br />In the unexpected surprise category, Shannon Hale, author of the fabulous <em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9781599900735">Princess Academy</a></em>, was signing copies of her new book<em>, Book of a Thousand Days</em>, so I got a a chance to meet her and her adorable baby daughter--it was a total thrill.  Also, I know all the girls at the store will be jealous as I got to meet John Green, who wrote the staff-recommended <em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9780525476887">An Abundance of Katherines</a></em>. I now have a signed copy, and I think I'll auction it off to whomever is willing to do my shelving the longest in exchange. My above-mentioned friend did her happy dance when she met him. If you don't know John Green, you need to check out <a href="http://www.brotherhood2.com/">Brotherhood 2.0</a>, the videoblog of him and his brother, Hank.<br /><br />Ok, there are other folks waiting for computers, so I'd better wrap it up...hopefully more later!
