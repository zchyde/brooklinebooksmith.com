Some use shelves. Some have empty shelves but lots of books. Some have full shelves and a tidy abode. A few have stacks on the floor in front of the shelves. Some have a full shelf, stacks on the floor (sort of) and a big ol' fresh stack on their desk. I am the latter. The photo above my stack in its most recent form - though a little bit positioned to give it a sexy aura. In reality, my desk is cluttered with books. Mostly chapbooks and pamphlets. Ephemera. I prefer it that way. What's the point in trying to get work done if you can't have a little fun? <br /><br />my biggest book-genre distractions are poetry, books about civil war-era generals who (debatably) went haywire, books about the building of books, and, the sweet-tooth of them all, books about carnival barkers. So here it is, This Stack of Books on My Desk:<ul><br />O City by Wayne Miller<br />Boris By The Sea by Matvei Yankelevich<br />Bookbinding by Edith Diehl<br />The Last Stand by Nathaniel Philbrick (ARC)<br />Nightmare Alley by William L Gresham (ARC)<br />To Hell On A  Fast Horse by Mark Lee Gardner (ARC)<br />A Plate of Chicken by Matthew Rohrer<br />G-Point Almanac: Passyunk Lost by Kevin Verbone<br />Transcendental Studies by Keith Waldrop<br /></ul><br />All (except O City) I either got at or through Booksmith, which speaks to the diversity of our selection. Especially in the area of small presses. But that will be next week's topic.
