When a person brings in a bag, box or dresser drawer full of books, you can see a lot about a person: her life, her interests, the fads she's casting off. Or even more interesting, you can see a portrait of a couple, or a mother-daughter pair, or whatever configuration of people run errands together. Concurrently, over the course of a busy week of buying, strange patterns can emerge on a grander scale. Some weeks it will seem like a lot of people unloaded books on Buddhism, or classical liberalism, or like last week, a lot of cool finds relating to Patti Smith, one of the most IMPORTANT ARTISTS OF OUR TIME.<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Z5MrN8KN7GY/UG7_0zBPfLI/AAAAAAAAA3s/Skr6IImPWtI/s1600/just-kids-patt-smith-200x330.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Z5MrN8KN7GY/UG7_0zBPfLI/AAAAAAAAA3s/Skr6IImPWtI/s200/just-kids-patt-smith-200x330.jpg" width="133" /></a>Hyperbole is annoying, and with Ms. Smith in particular, the titles are a bit silly. At first she was the mother of punk rock, and as she grows older she becomes the great grandmother of punk (<a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/368381/december-13-2010/patti-smith">as she quipped on The Colbert Report</a>). But it is undeniable what a great musician she continues to be, and through reading both her memoir and her volumes of poetry, what a gifted, crystal clear and heartbreakingly beautiful observer and writer she is as well.<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j9ivNru9ouQ/UG7_ywUKKtI/AAAAAAAAA3c/wKfIgnj8rLg/s1600/patti1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j9ivNru9ouQ/UG7_ywUKKtI/AAAAAAAAA3c/wKfIgnj8rLg/s200/patti1.jpg" width="140" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">from <i>Woolgathering</i></td></tr></tbody></table>So what did we haul in the UBC? There's a copy of <i>Just Kids</i>, the memoir of her days with photographer Robert Mapplethorpe in the New York of the 70s, which reads like a scrappy k√ºnstlerroman and touchstone for an important time in the history of modern and post-modern American art. Photography, poetry, music. Poverty. Makin' it. Losing. Loving. It's all here. Johnny Depp loved it. Critics loved it. Booksellers loved it. Your book club will love it.<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TD1PKRrQJVo/UG7_zTRWujI/AAAAAAAAA3k/MeCHCl7_V6s/s1600/patti2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TD1PKRrQJVo/UG7_zTRWujI/AAAAAAAAA3k/MeCHCl7_V6s/s200/patti2.jpg" width="134" /></a>Furthermore, in the wake of her successful memoir, New Directions published an earlier book of Smith's, <i>Woolgathering&nbsp;</i>a sort of memoir written in vignettes. Beautiful little scraps of memories from her childhood and reflections on growing up accompanied by beautiful, fascinating photographs.<br /><br />And finally, we acquired a copy of <i>Seventh Heaven</i>, collecting Smith's fan fiction of the hit WB family drama. Or, perhaps on further inspection it's a rare collection of her poetry printed in the 70s, as raw and real and punchy as her best lyrics. Snatch it up, it's a collector's item.
