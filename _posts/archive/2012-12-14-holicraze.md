It's crazybusy, hectic and we're ravenously hungry for empty carbs and sugar at all points of the day. BRING IT ON, BROOKLINE! We're hand-selling machines; we've got awesome ideas for everything and we're running on way too much coffee!<br /><br />But the crowds definitely mean one thing...all the great books we have are flyin' outta here. So come get 'em while they're hot.<br /><br />First of all, if you are shopping for your boyfriend or any human being that loved legos as a kid, snatch up a copy of Building Stories by Chris Ware. This box is a deconstructed graphic novel that you can build into a neighborhood block; then peak into the building's windows like a voyeur and follow the story there, and in the myriad pamphlets included. The print run of this magic puzzle box is out, and because of it's unique structure the next print won't be out until January. One of our dynamo booksellers wheeled and dealed all over town to get us some extra copies, but they're flying off the shelves so nab one now while you can. Perfect gift for all kinds of interesting people; readers or no.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OlRPTBpkxx0/UMtWczg_y_I/AAAAAAAABC8/p7yc9i7IGaU/s1600/cat_and_balloons_by_bobbyfufu-d3d08mm.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OlRPTBpkxx0/UMtWczg_y_I/AAAAAAAABC8/p7yc9i7IGaU/s1600/cat_and_balloons_by_bobbyfufu-d3d08mm.jpg" height="133" width="200" /></a>We just got a huge shipment of even more gift wrap; really great paper and bags made out of beautiful materials recycled and otherwise with adorable designs. Be the envy under the tree this year!<br /><br />Hanukkah is winding down, so be sure to snatch up some awesome platters from the Card and Gift room and pile in those latkes while it's still socially acceptable to do so! Also, how many Hanukkah rubber duckies do you have? THAT IS NOT ENOUGH COME GET MORE RUN DON'T WALK.<br /><br />Come say hi! Bring us donuts! We'll lead you to the perfect gifts for you and yours! Love you, Brookline!
