<span style="color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Reportedly, there was a mini-baby boom in 2006. (Google it. It's a thing.) I believe it because I'm seeing the results: right now, a&nbsp;</span><em style="color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">lot</em><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">&nbsp;of customers are seeking gifts for kids who are new to reading.</span><br /><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"><br /></span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="line-height: 24px;">Buying for this phase of childhood can cause anxiety with a lot of gift buyers, who are concerned they'll get it "wrong." What if they insult an emerging reader with a book that's too easy? What if they present an insurmountable challenge in the form of a book that's too hard?</span></span><br /><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="line-height: 24px;"><br /></span></span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="line-height: 24px;">Don't panic.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="line-height: 24px;"><br /></span></span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="line-height: 24px;">The books in our Learning to Read and First Chapter Books sections are designed to be great introductions to reading independently, but they're also perfect to read aloud with a favorite adult (and after a few readings, a book that was once too hard may be less so). Concerned about a book being too easy? Think about it this way: is your own reading material - your professional reading, your pleasure reading, the bookstore blog you're currently perusing -&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif; line-height: 24px;">&nbsp;all at the same level of difficulty?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif; line-height: 24px;">As important as it is to learn the "when two vowels go walking" rule (I've always felt sorry for the second vowel, which doesn't get to do the talking), I think the most important thing you can teach a new reader about reading is that it's fun, that it can be about anything. &nbsp;It can be about <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/apachesolr_search/national%20geographic%20leveled%20readers">your interests</a>; it can be <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/apachesolr_search/elephant%20and%20piggie">hilarious</a>; it can be about <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780786838837">kids like you</a> or kids who are kind of like you except that they <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781935279730">live somewhere else</a> or they're <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780142408889">genius detectives</a>. I</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif; line-height: 24px;">t can even be about <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780545175340">potty humor</a>, whether your parents like it or not.</span><br /><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="line-height: 24px;"><br /></span></span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="line-height: 24px;">So, gift buyers, stop worrying. (At least about this gift. We'll get to your Aunt Millie next.)</span></span><br /><br /><br style="color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;" />
