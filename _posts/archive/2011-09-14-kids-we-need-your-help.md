We tell you our favorites day in and day out, but we would like to hear your children's!&nbsp; Soon we will be starting up a children's newsletter focusing on upcoming events, new releases, and musing of the children's section.&nbsp; We're looking for kids of all ages to write to us and tell us what their favorite book is and why. (Make sure to provide us with first names and ages as well. Send in your entries to <a href="mailto:emily@brooklinebooksmith.com">emily@brooklinebooksmith.com</a>.)&nbsp; We look forward to hearing about what is on your shelves, whether it is a new release or an older classic!
