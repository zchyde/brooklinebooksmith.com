I've loved the work of Christopher Moore for years. I remember reading <i>Fluke</i>&nbsp;in the summer between high school and college, not sure what to make of it but also being astounded that you can write that in a book and get away with it. Absurd, glorious, bawdy--I thought it was all fantastic.<br /><br />As a full-fledged adult, I've been lucky enough to meet Christopher Moore and even luckier to meet his legion of equally irrelevant fans. They've made bad jokes and I've made worse jokes, but it makes me love them all even more. Over the years I've collected bits and pieces of publisher-distributed Christopher Moore paraphernalia: bookmarks, a <i>Fool</i>&nbsp;t-shirt, a poster with the cover of<i>&nbsp;Sacr√© Bleu. </i>Yesterday morning, though, I found my favorite Chris Moore item, a three-pair of <a href="http://www.throx.com/fsox/FS-BKSTO.html" target="_blank">stockings</a> sent to me from the man himself.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FlglMDRWvRY/U1ad0mh_r6I/AAAAAAAACrw/g2ejYbrtFrI/s1600/blog5.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FlglMDRWvRY/U1ad0mh_r6I/AAAAAAAACrw/g2ejYbrtFrI/s1600/blog5.JPG" height="320" width="199" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Christopher Moore-commissioned stockings, a copy of <i>The Serpent of Venice</i>, and a little gnome just because.</td></tr></tbody></table>We have a whole box of them, which Chris will be randomly distributing during the event. Want some of your own? Well, get your tickets at<a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/ticketedevents" target="_blank"> brooklinebooksmith.com/tickets</a> and head to Coolidge Corner on May 7. You'll know you're there when you find yourself among a legion of rabid fans, all wearing thigh-high stockings and clutching their own copy of <i>The Serpent of Venice</i>.
