Penguins are quite the coveted pet, at least in children's literature.  And, if there was such a thing as a domesticated penguin, who wouldn't want one of these fashionable, fun creatures?  Lower the room temp and make a bed in the freezer, and that's all there is to it, right?  Just ask the experience of Joe and Osbert in <em><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763657307">My Penguin Osbert</a></em>.  Or, compare notes with the French family who is sent a new penguin every day for a year in <em><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780810944602">365 Penguins</a></em>; or, the father (or better yet, ask his family)&nbsp;who acquires 12 penguins in the classic <em><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316186469">Mr. Popper's Penguins</a></em>.  Okay, maybe taking care of a penguin is a little more of an adjustment -- unless you are Elliot, the son of a science nerd.&nbsp; <div>&nbsp;</div><div> </div><div>In <em><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780803734135">One Cool Friend</a></em>, Elliot asks his father if he could buy a penguin at the aquarium.  The answer is "yes."  But, the question is, does his father realize he means a real penguin?  Elliot certainly forms a quick friendship with Magellan and is knowledgeable on caring for him.  They are quite the snazzy dressers, too.  This is a great, funny picturebook to add to your winter&nbsp;library.  (ages 2-7)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-85pNr-QFYqw/TxdmPJ7jJMI/AAAAAAAAASw/rXh0iFVzBiU/s1600/5534-2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-85pNr-QFYqw/TxdmPJ7jJMI/AAAAAAAAASw/rXh0iFVzBiU/s320/5534-2.jpg" width="196" /></a></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div>
