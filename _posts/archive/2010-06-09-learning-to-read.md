We’ve expanded our Learning to Read section.  More than doubled the selection actually.<br /><br />So, whether you are looking for some quick new reads, some familiar classics, or you know a young one who is learning to read, stop on by.  I’ve also heard of parents using early readers to read to their kids at night because level 1, 2, and 3 books look longer.  But, reading one of these beginning-to-read-books is actually shorter than the average picturebook.  So, you do the math. :)<br /><br />Our selection goes beyond <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780448434001">Dick and Jane</a></span> and “Cat sat on the rat.  Rat went tap.”  Blech!  No wonder there are kids who aren’t interested in reading.<br /><br />Let’s peruse some of our new arrivals:<br /><br />Being sick is one thing.  Being sick on the day of the class play…just terrible! (<span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780152050214">Iris and Walter: The School Play</a></span>)<br /><br />What good can come out of a cat who only chases kittens and lives in an old barrel? (<span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780064440387">Fire Cat</a></span>)<br /><br />Two cows dress up like chickens to crack the case! (<span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780060730093">Minnie and Moo: The Case of the Missing Jelly Donut</a></span>)<br /><br />You’ve never been to a slumber party you say?  You can read about that, too. (<span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780152056742">Iris and Walter: The Sleepover</a></span> and <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780448417394">Pajama Party</a></span><br /><br />Enjoy the excitement of a loose tooth all over again or for the first time.  (<span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780060527785">Loose Tooth</a></span>)<br /><br />Remember that classic <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780394829128">Wacky Wednesday</a></span>?  Yes, it’s still around as are many Dr. Seuss books (<span style="font-style: italic;">Wacky Wednesday</span> was written under one of Seuss’s other pen names of Theo LeSeig).<br /><br />Sounds and traditions of going to bed does not mean that a certain little boy is asleep. (Jack Prelutsky’s <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780060537227">My Parents Think I’m Sleeping</a></span>)?<br /><br />The time has come, the time is now, the time has come to go read something now! (Sound familiar?  <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780394824901">Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Go Now?</a></span>)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TBA7_091VlI/AAAAAAAAADY/cCFz3QZZX1M/s1600/IMG_4265.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TBA7_091VlI/AAAAAAAAADY/cCFz3QZZX1M/s320/IMG_4265.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5480946714245682770" border="0" /><br /><br /></a>
