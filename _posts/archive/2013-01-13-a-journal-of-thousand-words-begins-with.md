<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">It's a brand new year! The race is on to see who can stop writing 2012 on their rent checks first.</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">In the spirit of fresh starts, here's a small selection of the many many journals we sell:</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LbE-gQGOHkQ/UPHaz4YpnnI/AAAAAAAAACw/n9L92poSZiI/s1600/photo+(8).JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LbE-gQGOHkQ/UPHaz4YpnnI/AAAAAAAAACw/n9L92poSZiI/s400/photo+(8).JPG" width="298" /></span></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: x-small;">Our pages await your delicious thoughts!</span></td></tr></tbody></table><div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">JOURNALS: combining the spiritual renewal of a gym membership/juice cleanse with the heady indulgence of eating ice cream sans pants. Resolutions are all well and good but now that the crazy gift-giving holidays are behind us, things get to be all about you again. Take a moment to let that sink in. What better way to take advantage of this intoxicating new-found freedom than by giving your brain somewhere to really take root? Trust me, you deserve it.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">But maybe you lack the intestinal fortitude to be left all alone with your muse. Maybe the thought of blank white paper makes your palms sweat and your blood run cold. Maybe the symbolic stain of those first few inked thoughts is just a little too much to bear. I feel you, bro.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">For the hesitant, here are a few unconventional journaling techniques to help you face down writer's block and blossom into that incandescent word-machine you burn to be:</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">-&nbsp;<b>Write outside</b> - or on the train, or at Starbucks on your lunch break. There's nothing sacred about a desk.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">-&nbsp;<b>Record your dreams</b> - even the most vivid nocturnal phantasms fade from memory in the harsh light of day. Keep a pen and paper handy on the nightstand to assure that Fabio's marriage proposal stays fresh in your mind.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">-&nbsp;<b>Catalogue day-to-day inspiration </b>- you know what we had before Pinterest? Paper.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">-&nbsp;<b>Keep a running tally of all who have wronged you</b> - then, stew in your own resentment. Then burn the journal. Wait, don't do that, it's too pretty. Meditate on forgiveness (or vengeance, which might make for better reading).</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">- <b>Bring your journal to a séance</b> (<a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/event/ian-svenonius-supernatural-strategies" target="_blank">AHEM</a>) and let otherworldly spirits take possession of your motor abilities. This is a bona fide method for finding out where Great-Grandpa hid the family fortune. Or getting Abraham Lincoln's autograph.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><div></div><div></div></div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">-&nbsp;<b>Make a yearbook</b> - not just for high school anymore! Collect inscriptions from all your friends and co-workers. I recommend a multi-pack of neon gel pens to really amp up the nostalgia.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">-&nbsp;<b>Live-tweet your journaling experience:</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Day 1. Wow I can't wait to unleash my inner Samuel Pepys!"</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Day 2. Have unleashed inner James Frey.&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/booksmithtweets" target="_blank">@booksmithtweets</a>&nbsp;I&nbsp;blame you for this"</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Day 3. S'all good - unleashing inner Joan Didion. My words are brutal beauty. Owe it all to Booksmith."</span></div>
