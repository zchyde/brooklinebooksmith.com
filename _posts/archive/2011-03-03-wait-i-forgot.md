Paul and I were working the tickets (and just generally workin' <b>it</b>) outside the Coolidge Corner Theatre, where the event was held, and then it was back to the bookstore for the book signing.<br /><br />The event went really smoothly, thank you to everyone that came down and waited outside the theater in the freezing cold! I didn't get to see the reading but I was up close and personal near Jodi for her signing and I was really impressed with her professionalism and cordiality; she seemed genuinely psyched to speak to and take a picture with every single one of her fans, the line of which snaked even out our front door at one point. <br /><br />And, as always, if you didn't manage to make it to the event you should stop by the store or give us a call in case we still have signed copies for sale.
