Where were they from? Where had they been? Soon the map was covered with post-its. Between the eight of us, we had covered the continents, from Spain to New Zealand. While we marveled at our mobility, we also had to face a serious question. If the world is this connected, what is the place and purpose of travel writing, a genre that developed with the discovery of the world? Explorers used to write home, describing the new lands they saw. Today, if a reader can type Tahiti, they can see paradise.</div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BYBL81SWLbI/Uhu7HarkYtI/AAAAAAAAAvQ/MDuP-ob4NEg/s1600/FC9781743216880.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BYBL81SWLbI/Uhu7HarkYtI/AAAAAAAAAvQ/MDuP-ob4NEg/s1600/FC9781743216880.JPG" /></a>Simon Garfield's new book&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781592407798" href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781592407798"><em>On the Map</em>&nbsp;</a>opens with a spread&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/19/entertainment/la-ca-jc-simon-garfield-20130120" href="https://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/19/entertainment/la-ca-jc-simon-garfield-20130120">Facebook's map of connectivity</a>.&nbsp;Someone put in all the coordinates of Facebook users, and out of the void a map arose, formed through millions of threaded connections. Despite the fact that we can travel the world on our iPad, the genre of travel writing persists. People still feel compelled to write what they saw, and I can vouch for the fact that there are readers out there, because I talk to them every day, as they browse our Destination Literature shelves.</div><br /><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eyE9lz-kz6U/Uhu7RqGf9RI/AAAAAAAAAvY/MJnEhh2FCzo/s1600/FC9781609520847.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eyE9lz-kz6U/Uhu7RqGf9RI/AAAAAAAAAvY/MJnEhh2FCzo/s1600/FC9781609520847.JPG" /></a>So travel writers: take heart.
