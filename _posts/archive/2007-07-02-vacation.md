It could not come at a better time. Even people who love their job need some time away, and I've been feeling the need to be out of this basement for a bit. I'll be headed to the Pacific Northwest, spending a few days in Victoria then Seattle and I'm thinking there will be some good time for just reading and relaxing.<br /><br />I'm an over-packer by nature, which extends to books, so I know I won't get to everything, but I'm bringing myself a nice selection to chose from depending on my mood. When travelling one always needs a good mystery, so I'm bringing two: <strong><em>Interred with Their Bones</em></strong> by Jennifer Lee Carrell (she wrote <em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9780452285071">The Speckled Monster</a></em>, an Essential Read of Evelyn's) and <strong><em>The Night Climbers</em></strong> by Ivo Stourton. I'm bringing the kids' book <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;initiate=yes&fromauthor=yes&amp;author=5839208"><strong><em>The Name of This Book Is Secret</em></strong> </a>by Pseudonymous Bosch, and for non-fiction, Daniel Brook's <strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9780805080650">The Trap: Selling Out to Stay Afloat In Winner-Take-All America</a></em></strong>.<br /><br />I'll have to take something as a security blanket, too, something I know will be good, so I'll probably take along something by <a href="http://www.squeetus.com/stage/main.html">Shannon Hale</a>. I've just finished <strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9781599900513">Book of a Thousand Days</a></em></strong>, (STUPENDOUS!), so it's put me in a mood for more.<br /><br />OK, I'm off!
