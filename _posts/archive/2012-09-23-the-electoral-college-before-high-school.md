So I don't know if you've missed this minor news item, but there's an election coming up pretty soon here in the U.S. Caucuses, conventions, debates, debacles, balloon launches, accusations of buffoonery... it's a lot to keep straight. But if there's someone in your life who's not old enough to vote yet, but who <em>is</em> old enough to wonder what on earth everyone's talking about, we've got a few books to help you explain things.<br /><br /><em>See How They Run: Campaign Dreams, Election Schemes, and the Race to the White House</em> takes a cartoonish approach, but the light tone doesn't mean it's light on information. Starting with the Ancient Greek origins of democracy, it takes readers right up to the present and delivers plenty of vocabulary and honest, age-appropriate information about the contention that occasionally accompanies elections. Similarly, <em>Where Do Presidents Come From?: And Other Presidential Stuff of Super-Great Importance</em> uses the graphic format to explore lots of aspects of choosing--and being-- a president. <em>The Election Book: The People Pick a President </em>does the same, but in a more traditional prose form.<br /><br />If you like a little fiction with your facts, there's <em>The Kid Who Ran for President</em> and (spoiler alert) <em>The Kid Who Became President</em>. There's also <em>Bad Kitty for President</em>, because who can resist "the purrrfect candidate?" (It says that on the cover. You can't blame me for this one.)<br />That's just a few of the election-related books for kids that we have on display. Come in to find more!<br /><br />We're Brookline Booksmith, and we approve this message.
