I had a really great conversation with a customer recently--we were talking about <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781400063970"><strong><em>The 19<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">th</span> Wife</em></strong> </a>by David <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Ebershoff</span>, which contains two parallel stories, one set in the past and one in the present. The 19<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">th</span> century storyline revolves around the true (but fictionalized ) story of Anne Eliza Young, one of Brigham Young's many wives and a crusader for the abolition of Mormon polygamy. In the present day Jordan Scott, the son of the 19<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">th</span> wife of a current polygamist must try to exonerate his mother, who is accused of murdering her spouse.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book but mentioned that I much preferred the historical storyline to the contemporary and we were talking about how novels that attempt to carry on two <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">storylines</span> often have a hard time balancing both--one tends to come out much stronger.  However, I have to propose one book that strikes a perfect balance: <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780679735908"><strong><em>Possession</em></strong> </a>by A.S. <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">Byatt</span>. One of my all-time favorite novels, <em>Possession</em> alternates between a pair of Victorian poets and the present-day scholars who research them.<br /><br />What are your favorite novels that successfully bridge the divide between parallel <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">storylines</span>?
