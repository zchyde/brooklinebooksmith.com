I love books and I love movies, so I'm always interested when the former become the latter. I know plenty of people who moan over it, but I don't.<br /><br />For one thing it often brings people to books they may have otherwise forgotten or overlooked. <a href="http://www.coolidge.org/">The Coolidge Corner Theater</a> recently played the new adaptation of <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780316042994"><strong><em>Brideshead Revisited</em></strong> </a>and we've sold more copies of that title in six weeks than we did all of last year.<br /><br />I also think you can like the book better (you'll always like the book better!) but still find a lot of value in the film. I remember getting into a pretty fierce argument with a friend over an adaptation of <strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780307386885">Mansfield Park</a></em></strong>. She argued that the director had totally misunderstood and abused Austen's characters and as a result she absolutely hated the film. In some ways she was right--the Fanny Price of the movie was a very different heroine than she was in the book. But I still loved it. I enjoyed what it was for what it was and I appreciated that it made me reexamine the book, what I liked about it and how I understood it.<br /><br />I got to thinking about all this as Wednesday's <a href="http://www.publishersmarketplace.com/lunch/subscribe.html">Publishers Lunch </a>posted <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3icaabfeb875c91a9ea2aa8044d64695df?imw=Y">an item from <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> </a>about a kerfuffle regarding the series of movies in the works based on <strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780316358323">Tintin</a></em></strong>. I hadn't even realized movies were being made! And the kerfuffle is over whether Steven Spielberg or Peter Jackson is directing? I'm smiling either way.<br /><br />What do you think about movie adaptations? Do you have any favorite (or hated!) book-to-movie translations?
