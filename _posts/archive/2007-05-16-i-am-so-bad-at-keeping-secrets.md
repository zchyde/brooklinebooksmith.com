So Brian, our events manager, emailed me today with the names of some of the authors we'll be having soon. I was going to tease you all and give hints and initials and all sorts of stuff like that, but, well, I'm so excited that I just can't not share--<a href="https://www.lisasee.com/">Lisa See</a>! <a href="https://www.jasperfforde.com/">Jasper Fforde</a>! <a href="https://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/">William Gibson</a>! And, for something completely diffrerent-- <a href="https://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047010869X.html">Tedy Bruschi</a>! There's more, but I've been sworn to secrecy...
