<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Guys I can't figure out how to embed a quiz function in Blogger so get out a pencil &amp; paper or iPhone or neurally-embedded microchip or whatever the kids are using nowadays to write things down.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b>Should you fire your muse?</b> A quiz:</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Choose one answer per question. No cheating.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b>1.</b> <i>I am currently reading:</i></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">A) Dude, like, thirty different books. I'm running out of bookmarks. It's kind of a dire situation actually. I just can't resist that dollar cart.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">B) It's this novel about this guy whose father is a drug-dealer and he recruits his son to mule drugs through small-town airports for him but then this guy double-crosses his dad after falling in love in a diner and I don't want to tell you what happens because it's really gripping but also a super moving portrait, like you really connect with the character, I swear I was moved to tears, you really have to read it, here you can borrow my copy.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">C) &nbsp;Something featured on NPR.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">D) Something with a spaceship on the cover.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b>2</b>. <i>My ideal work space is:</i></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">A) 4am me my desk and coffee coffee coffee all the coffee</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">B) Around people/out in public (not necessarily at a cafe because that's a major cliche and originality is more or less the point of this whole venture but also a coffee counter within ambling distance wouldn't be too shabby either let's be honest).</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">C) A lush private garden. Y'know like the overgrown kind with ancient trees dripping with ivy and small woodland creatures and maybe a dilapidated hedge maze.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">D) I have all my best ideas in the shower.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b>3</b>. <i>Preferred timepiece:</i></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">A) Wristwatch/Pocketwatch</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">B) Phone</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">C) Little digital screen on the microwave&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">D) Position of the sun</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b>4</b>. I'd dump a potential significant other if they:</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">A) Gave me a cutesy nickname.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">B) Ate the last potato chip and then left the empty bag in the cupboard and THEN didn't even write it on the grocery list.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">C) Touched my butt in public.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">D) Get annoyed when I pop the bubble wrap that comes in the packages I order from ebay for the express purpose of getting bubble wrap. Life's little pleasures. Come on.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b>5</b>.<i> I believe in:</i></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">A) God</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">B) Myself</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">C) Anti-oxidants</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">D) Whichever answer sounds the most cynical.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><i>Results:</i></b> Yes you should fire your muse. Internet quizzes are the lowest circle of inspiration hell; the last bastion of bored procrastinators. Your muse is clearly not even trying.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Fear not, citizens! Your scores have been tabulated by our most advanced computers (they beep!) and your ideal fount of passionate creativity assessed. Google your new muse, bask in their genius, then go forth. Make art.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">If you answered:</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Mostly As - Natalie Portman (admit it, most gorgeous person ever, also brilliant, also I think vegan or at least vegetarian).</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Mostly Bs - Junot Diaz, my favorite writer to ever speak here, by the way. Oh my god he shook my hand.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Mostly Cs - A majestic wild beast who nonetheless possesses some startlingly anthropomorphic feature(s), (eyes of measureless wisdom, can talk, is good at scrabble, etc.) Go reread C. S. Lewis.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Mostly Ds - George Takei, god-king of the internet.</span>
