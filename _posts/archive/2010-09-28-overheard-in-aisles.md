The bookstore, like anywhere, can be a funny place. We're often treated to <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">snippets</span> of conversation as customers pass by or as we pass by people in the aisles. I particularly love this found sound.  Sometimes the out of context sentence can be most entertaining.  Or bittersweet.  Or just downright weird.  I thought I'd share a few actual overheard statements from my recent travels around the store:<br /><br /><br /><strong>Woman</strong>: "...with his <em>cat</em>, Sir Paul McCartney."<br /><strong>Man</strong>: "Oh my god, <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">ew</span>."<br /><br /><br /><strong>Woman</strong>: "She swears she got it from drinking too much soda."<br /><strong>Man</strong>: "Wow, I've heard that can happen."<br /><br /><br />"Mommy, what are these eyeballs for?"<br /><br /><br /><strong>Man on phone</strong>: "I'm sorry, but we're going with another candidate. It's not personal."<br /><br /><br /><p><strong>Woman on phone</strong>:  "Well, honey, I can't keep track of your boys anymore.  I'm not even going to try.  Do you want to talk to your father?"</p><p><strong>Woman <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">browsing</span> remainders</strong>: "Oh my god!!!  They have "Fool" in remainder!!  I <em>hated</em> this book."</p><p>And then there's the common sight of a screaming child being led out the door:  "I want a book!!  I want a book!!!  I don't wanna go!!  I want a book!!"  Which is sad for the kid but also kind of cool.  </p><p>Have a great day!<br /></p>
