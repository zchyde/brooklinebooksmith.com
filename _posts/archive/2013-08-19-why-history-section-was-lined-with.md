It just seemed that way this Saturday, when a line of strollers stretched halfway down Aisle 3. Twenty,&nbsp;count&nbsp;'em, twenty people gathered at 10:30, all&nbsp;to hear<em> The Circus Ship, Mustache Baby, </em>and<em>&nbsp;Llama Llama and the Bully Goat</em> read in Clarissa's dulcet tones.<br /><br />Our recently revived Children's Storytime is different every time, but it's growing!&nbsp;We've had small crowds and large crowds like yesterday, very young crowds and savvier crowds of kindergarteners and first graders. The whole thing is super-informal; though we pick out the books ahead of time, we let the audience influence our delivery. (If you hear us call it a "story hour," don't take that second word literally.) Kids of all ages are welcome, babies and toddlers included, as long as their grownups are on hand. We read new books; we read favorites; we read good stuff, we think.<br /><br />To reiterate the vital stats, Children's Storytime takes place at 10:30 on&nbsp;the third Saturday and last Sunday of every month; upcoming dates include this Sunday, 8/25; Saturday, 9/21; and Sunday, 9/29.&nbsp; It takes place right in our kids' section; you'll know it's happening if we've dragged out the giant striped rug (thanks to many booksellers for their help schlepping that thing). No need to sign up; just show up!<br />
