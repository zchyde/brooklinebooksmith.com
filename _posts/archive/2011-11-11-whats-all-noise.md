<div>Books may not make a whole 'lotta noise on their own, except maybe for the satisfying sound of a cracking spine (BOOK spine!). But books can certainly be splendiferously sonorous: great volumes of poetry and well-written children's books BEG to be read aloud and shared, and just as many books are the conveyances of great music or the science thereof. Below are a few recent finds in the Used Book Cellar that showcase the gamut of sound-related books for part two of my little blog-series on UBC finds and the senses...</div><i><div><i><br /></i></div><div><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fK3M-dMncR0/TrmDF9L1AvI/AAAAAAAAALQ/8CsNf-ZZnCs/s1600/13996_singing_life_birds_kroodsma.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fK3M-dMncR0/TrmDF9L1AvI/AAAAAAAAALQ/8CsNf-ZZnCs/s200/13996_singing_life_birds_kroodsma.jpg" width="160" /></a><i><br /></i></div>The Singing Life of Birds</i>&nbsp;by Donald Kroodsma is a book on how to listen to bird's sing. You wouldn't think you'd need to read a whole book weighing in at 400-some-odd pages, but this bad boy delves deep into the science of bird songs, as well as differences in songs among many types of birds. It even comes with a CD to follow what Kroodsma is talking about. It's a beautiful hardcover in fantastic condition that would make an excellent gift for the avian audiophile in your life.<div><br /></div><div><div><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y8-SI3SLTQk/TrmDGW9-6PI/AAAAAAAAALY/cDYH9LDIWAQ/s1600/little_critter.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><br /><img border="0" height="200" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y8-SI3SLTQk/TrmDGW9-6PI/AAAAAAAAALY/cDYH9LDIWAQ/s200/little_critter.jpg" width="200" /></a><i><div><i><br /></i></div>Just a Little Critter Collection</i> by Mercer Mayer is a a collection of seven of the Little Critter books all in one volume. No more reaching for another and then another when the little one(s) cry "MORE!" - the crème de la crème of America's favorite monster are all handily bound in a not-unwieldy&nbsp;volume. Whenever I think of read-alouds, the first that comes to mind is&nbsp;Little Critter. Of all the books in my library as a child, Little Critter were my mom's favorite to read over and over, (HI MOM!) and perhaps that's why I have so many fond memories of her voice reading the refrains ("I was <i>so</i>&nbsp;<i>mad!</i>") when I think of childhood, books, or nondescript&nbsp;lovable critters. Pick up a copy and make it your family's bedtime favorite.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2T2r0OcxTyI/Trma2Ov02QI/AAAAAAAAALg/PX4FU6BPutE/s1600/vermont+sings.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2T2r0OcxTyI/Trma2Ov02QI/AAAAAAAAALg/PX4FU6BPutE/s200/vermont+sings.jpg" width="107" /></a></div><div><i>Vermont Sings</i>&nbsp;is a tiny pamphlet of sheet music printed in 1959. It has great lettering throughout and a lovely illustration on the cover. The songs within all celebrate the awesomeness of Vermont, and there are even a few songs in French and German. It's a great little find that celebrates music AND The Green Mountain State. Win!</div></div><div><br /></div><div>That's all from the UBC this week, folks, thanks for reading. If'n you have any books to sell, be sure to bring them by Wednesday through Saturday, 10 AM-4 PM. Tune in next week when I celebrate all things tasty for the Thanksgiving holiday.</div>
