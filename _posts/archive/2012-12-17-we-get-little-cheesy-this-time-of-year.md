<span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">"Booksmith was my childhood," an adult customer&nbsp;told me this week as she checked out. She shared a few early memories of finding specific books, all of which have since flown out of my head, because the store is gloriously insane these days.&nbsp;But amid that insanity, it's bolstering to remember that that's what we're doing: we're helping people make memories. I'm reminded of this now&nbsp;as a group of customers ask me to take their picture from my post at Infosmith. I'm reminded of it every time&nbsp;a dog drags his or her owner from the street straight to the register. (Psssst -&nbsp;we have dog biscuits.) I'm reminded when a longtime customer calls us by our original name, "Paperback Booksmith," or tells me, "I've been coming here since before you were born."</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Young repeat visitors clamour to see their old friend the bear, and yesterday, an even younger, newly talking visitor said "books" so clearly, I could've sworn she was about to give me a dissertation on her favorites. Everyone from preteens on up waxes nostalgic upon encountering childhood favorites; even the adults who think they don't remember anything about children's books melt at the mention of Beverly Cleary, Richard Scarry, or both.<br /><br />I don't know whether they'll remember that <em>Little Mermaid</em> book from the spinner or whether they'll stump future booksellers by half-recalling the titles of the books they get this season. (Write 'em down now, kids. "Mysterious Benedict Society" is quite a mouthful to remember for a generation.) But everything I'm seeing these days - the crazy moments when everyone's being paged in twelve different directions, and the quieter moments of reflection on this special thing we've got here - makes me suspect that fifty-plus years from now, there will still be booksellers to stump.</span><br />
