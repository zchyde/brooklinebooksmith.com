It's my favorite weekend in Boston--it's Head of the Charles! There is so much I adore about <a href="https://www.hocr.org/home/default.asp">Head of the Charles</a>--I love that it's a perfect way to spend fall days outside before it gets too cold. You'll find me eating fair food (you have not had a caramel apple until you've had a fresh-dipped caramel apple from the Boy Scout troop that's at HotC every year), petting adorable dogs, and, of course, watching the crews race down the river. It is a sight both absolutely beautiful and incredbily fierce. And, I love when you can hear the coxes swearing like sailors to get their boys or girls to go harder, faster, stronger.<br /><br />Folks are usually pretty surprised when they find out I'm a crew fan, but I have been for quite a while--ever since college, when I discovered a high school crush rowed for his university. Ah, the early years of internet stalking. (I'll take this moment to remind you that I went to a women's college) In my quest to find pictures of my darling dreamboat I ended up on sites like <a href="https://row2k.com/">this one</a>, and I ended up sticking around longer than was probably necessary, but it is how I learned about one of the best books on sports <em>ever</em>--David Halberstam's <strong><em><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780449910030">The Amateurs</a></em></strong>. It's a classic.<br /><br />If, after reading <em>The Amateurs</em>, you want more on rowing, my suggestion would be <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780618001842"><strong><em>Mind Over Water</em></strong> </a>by Craig Lambert, but you'll probably realize that what you actually want is more of Mr. Halberstam. You could pick up <strong><em><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781401300524">The Coldest Winter: America and the Korean War</a></em></strong>, the book he finished just before his death earlier this year, which has been getting fantastic reviews. But, in keeping with the Boston sports theme, I would suggest either <strong><em><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781401308797">The Education of a Coach</a></em></strong>, Halberstam's exploration of Patriot's coach Bill Belichick or <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780786888672"><strong><em>The Teammates: A Portrait of Friendship</em></strong> </a>, a look at some of the greats of Boston Red Sox baseball. Happy reading!
