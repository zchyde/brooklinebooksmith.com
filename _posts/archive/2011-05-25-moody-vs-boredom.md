But, did you know that Megan McDonald co-wrote the script? And, that the movie is based off of her new book -- as opposed to the series combined as <i><a href="https://brooklinebooksmith.blogspot.com/2010/07/100-ramona-quimby.html">Ramona and Beezus</a></i> was done?<br /><br />It's a nice change really.&nbsp; I mean even when a movie is well done, if it completely alters the theme or moral of the original text, it just falls flat.&nbsp; Knowing the mastermind and creator behind Judy and her crazy antics and ever changing moods is behind the scenes here&nbsp;makes me look forward to this movie even more.&nbsp; Or, "Super-cali-fragi-listic-expi-thrilla-delic!" in the words of Judy.<br /><br />Read the book that made the movie, now in stock!&nbsp; The movie will&nbsp;appear in theaters&nbsp;June 10th.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="https://3.gvt0.com/vi/UukpvGLVWVs/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/UukpvGLVWVs&fs=1&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><embed width="320" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/v/UukpvGLVWVs&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed></object></div>
