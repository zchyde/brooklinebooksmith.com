The elegant Ms. Winspear read to a packed audience of nearly 100 enthusiastic fans, including one who traveled all the way from New York to Brookline for a mid-week event. Bookseller Tom, whose fashion "Tommentary" has been gracing <a href="https://brooklinebooksmith.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">our tumblr</a> page, <a href="https://brooklinebooksmith.tumblr.com/post/91640465799/ms-winspear-looked-exactly-like-the-author-of" target="_blank">had this to say</a> about Ms. Winspear in his events round-up to the staff. <br /><br />2) <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316055437" target="_blank"><i>The Goldfinch</i> by Donna Tartt</a>&nbsp;- I'm sure you've read plenty of reviews of this Pulitzer Prize winning bestseller. But have you <a href="https://therumpus.net/2014/01/horn-reviews-the-goldfinch/" target="_blank"><b>seen</b></a> this review?<br /><br />3) <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/%5Bmodel%5D-858" target="_blank"><i>The Opposite of Loneliness: Essays and Stories</i> by Marina Keegan</a>, with an introduction by Anne Fadiman - Marina Keegan's life ended tragically early but what she left behind is nothing short of remarkable. The title essay, "<a href="https://yaledailynews.com/crosscampus/2012/05/27/keegan-the-opposite-of-loneliness/" target="_blank">The Opposite of Loneliness</a>," is a commencement address of sorts to her fellow students at Yale, and it went viral shortly after publication. But some of the&nbsp;other pieces in here are truly stunning for their depth and precocious wisdom. One of my favorites is the short, ruminative essay "Why We Care About Whales."<br /><br />4) <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/%5Bmodel%5D-311" target="_blank"><i>The Silkworm</i> by Robert Galbraith</a> - Curious about what J.K. Rowling thinks of the publishing industry? Rowling a.k.a Robert Galbraith has some <a href="https://www.newrepublic.com/article/118424/jk-rowlings-silkworm-shows-what-she-thinks-publishing-industry" target="_blank">not so veiled opinions</a> in this murder mystery set in literary London.<br /><br />5) <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/%5Bmodel%5D-882" target="_blank"><i>Euphoria</i> by Lily King</a> - One of the best things about hosting an event is discovering an author and a book you may not have picked up on your own. Margaret Mead, groundbreaking anthropologist...and the apex of a love triangle?&nbsp;<i>Euphoria</i>&nbsp;is the fictionalized story of Mead and her adventures in New Guinea with her first husband and soon-to-be second husband. Lily King has written the best kind of summer book - an exquisitely written page-turner.<br /><br />6) <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/%5Bmodel%5D-925" target="_blank"><i>Can't We Talk About Something More Pleasant? A Memoir</i> by Roz Chast&nbsp;</a>- I love graphic novels and memoirs for their ability to visualize emotionally heavy topics. Roz Chast, most well known for her cartoons in <i>The New Yorker</i>, is a local favorite and her memoir takes on coping with aging parents. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/05/08/310725572/a-cartoonists-funny-heartbreaking-take-on-caring-for-aging-parents" target="_blank">Ms. Chast's interview on Fresh Air </a>was spectacular, and sent many new fans to the store to buy her book.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Paperback Bestsellers</b></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3LQIwDt3lvY/U8V7N-6FiyI/AAAAAAAAQ78/qZwIX14exck/s1600/signature+of+things.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3LQIwDt3lvY/U8V7N-6FiyI/AAAAAAAAQ78/qZwIX14exck/s1600/signature+of+things.jpg" height="320" width="209" /></a></div>1) <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780143125846" target="_blank"><i>The Signature of All Things</i> by Elizabeth Gilbert&nbsp;</a>- Elizabeth Gilbert, memoirist, novelist, and <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/names/2014/07/13/tom-brady-joins-gisele-bundchen-brazil-for-world-cup/mB8ZZqPrcHwH6pwvUW4BJK/story.html" target="_blank">soccer fan</a>, read at the Coolidge on Sunday and charmed us all. One of our favorite local authors, Steve Almond, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/magazine/eat-pray-love-get-rich-write-a-novel-no-one-expects.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">wrote this profile for <i>The New York Times</i></a> about her leap from fiction, to <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>, and then back to fiction. <br /><br />2) <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780142424179" target="_blank"><i>The Fault in Our Stars</i> by John Green</a>&nbsp;- If you're curious about the man behind the young adult novel sensation, check out <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/06/09/140609fa_fact_talbot?currentPage=all" target="_blank">this profile on John Green in <i>The New Yorker</i></a>.<br /><br />3) <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/%5Bmodel%5D-755" target="_blank"><i>Americanah </i>by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</a>&nbsp;- I told you how much I love Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie right?

That is it—that the person has come into the books so seriously, so completely, that he or she, black or white, male or female, feels, That’s my story. I told it. I’m making it up on the spot. That’s the great compliment. I didn’t expect, originally, that I was going to continue with the form. I thought I was going to write a little book and it would be fine and I would go on back to poetry, write a little music."</span></div><br /><br /></div>
