Books about stitching and books<br />about magicians and<br />smothering<br /><br />and shape-shifting and war,<br />And chocolate.<br />And seven about heaven<br />and artists and love, and<br />loss,<br /><br />and birth and Prague,<br />Budapest, and<br />denial.<br /><br />And my children are asleep without me but I trust<br />they read books about trains and hedges and ducks, and<br />I don't know what will cross my path tomorrow.<br />Books about maps, or books about judges, or<br />books marked by fingertips, erasers, smudges.
