Please read it.<br /><br />So immediately after reading, I hunted down the advance of his upcoming novel, <em>How to Read the Air</em>, from which the short story is excerpted. It is powerful. Line up for your copy now. So far, it has the makings of a Great Book. I wish my break was now so that I could just go read more.<br /><br />He's coming here October 25, which is a ways away, but mark your calendar.<br /><br />P.S. More events excitement: while our event director Evan is off traversing Scotland on a mighty Highland Cow, I, his lackey, am on the verge of setting the official date for my favorite comedian of all time to read here in December. Gulp.<br /><br /><a href="http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~chicnmo/islay/backgrounds/Highland%20cow%20small.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 560px; height: 420;" src="http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~chicnmo/islay/backgrounds/Highland%20cow%20small.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
