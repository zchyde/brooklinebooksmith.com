Last sunday, if you have been walking through Coolidge Corner, you no doubt would have noticed the gargantuan Enterprise truck that was parked outside of our store, and the large cardboard cutouts that sufficiently bundled gentlemen were hastening to unload from it.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aatQYUyTKZY/VG6LsItXzAI/AAAAAAAAAik/yFBjquWxjDY/s1600/Screenshot%2B2014-11-20%2B19.45.51.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aatQYUyTKZY/VG6LsItXzAI/AAAAAAAAAik/yFBjquWxjDY/s1600/Screenshot%2B2014-11-20%2B19.45.51.png" height="333" width="400" /></a></div>This would have been for our event with Jeff Kinney, author of popular "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" series. This, however, was no usual event. This was a Jeff Kinney <i>experience, </i>complete with stations, games, photo ops, and finally, a signed copy of your favorite Wimpy Kid books and a handshake with Jeff Kinney himself. It was like nothing Booksmith has ever done before, and frankly, after seeing how sucessful it was, I think we should probably start holding such events for adult books, too!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1lk1wmP62FY/VG6Mg4HR_VI/AAAAAAAAAis/ps9X2aUIfFI/s1600/Photo%2BNov%2B16%2C%2B1%2B08%2B59%2BPM%2B(1).jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1lk1wmP62FY/VG6Mg4HR_VI/AAAAAAAAAis/ps9X2aUIfFI/s1600/Photo%2BNov%2B16%2C%2B1%2B08%2B59%2BPM%2B(1).jpg" height="400" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Another day at the book store, complete with large fake pig</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Cj-SlIuIvWc/VG6MjaDuddI/AAAAAAAAAi0/HYWkna7PtpI/s1600/Photo%2BNov%2B16%2C%2B1%2B09%2B45%2BPM.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Cj-SlIuIvWc/VG6MjaDuddI/AAAAAAAAAi0/HYWkna7PtpI/s1600/Photo%2BNov%2B16%2C%2B1%2B09%2B45%2BPM.jpg" height="400" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">We were really worried you didn't have all the Wimpy Kid books....</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />In no time at all, folks started lining up and moving through the store. They visited all the booths, got to play 'Plinko', got a chance to guess the weight of a large paper mache pig. There was even a booth I didn't get to see in action, but consisted of a large table filled with old shoes. Curiosities were abundant! After interacting with, and having their picture taken by, numerous book store workers and event staff alike (some dressed up in top hats, coats and tails), event attendees found themselves outside Card and Gift, at the front of aisle 4. There, they got their books signed by Jeff Kinney, who was warm, welcoming, and engaging.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Dpb22Iu9EqQ/VG6NWLasFvI/AAAAAAAAAi8/53n2kveS3TM/s1600/Photo%2BNov%2B16%2C%2B6%2B27%2B35%2BPM.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Dpb22Iu9EqQ/VG6NWLasFvI/AAAAAAAAAi8/53n2kveS3TM/s1600/Photo%2BNov%2B16%2C%2B6%2B27%2B35%2BPM.jpg" height="640" width="480" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Clarissa and Zoe mug by one of the photo backdrops</td></tr></tbody></table>This event was a great success! We are looking forward to what other crazy events the kids book world can send our way! Old shoes, fake pigs, and lake backdrops, oh my!!<br /><div><br /></div><div>You can follow our events series by checking out <a href="http://brooklinebooksmith.com/events/mainevent.html" target="_blank">our events website,&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;which is kept painstakingly up to date.
