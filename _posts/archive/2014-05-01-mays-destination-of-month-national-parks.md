The weather's getting warm; the kids are getting out of school. It's time to be Winnebago Warriors and hit some of the most breathtaking sites in the world, lovingly preserved by your Federal government in what is probably one of the coolest, nerdiest undertakings in our history: the National Park Service.<br /><br />And you've got your pick, too, because America is as geographically diverse as her citizens are ethnically. Deserts? Check. Oceans? Check. Mountains? Check. Lakes? Check. Lakes that disappear and turn into fields of wildflowers for a few months? Check that too.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qv9qBT4DYgc/U1bhX9oelQI/AAAAAAAABgg/xZNfnFYBSLc/s1600/SierraClub_NPmap.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qv9qBT4DYgc/U1bhX9oelQI/AAAAAAAABgg/xZNfnFYBSLc/s1600/SierraClub_NPmap.jpg" height="321" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />So swing by throughout the month of May and scope our guidebooks, photo books, and even grab a narrative or novel or two that occupy some of the coolest spaces in our massive country.
