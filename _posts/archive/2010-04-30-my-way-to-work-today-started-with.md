My way to work today started with fifteen minutes sitting in the big stand of pines in our corner of the Forest Hills Cemetery, not a soul around but three or four squirrels, a crow, and perhaps 800,000 newly winged insects, maybe thee-eighths of an inch long, all putting their freshly unfurled wings to first use, and eager to hitch a ride whenever they can. They just sort of flew into me and clung, out of control and a touch desperate. It often takes an insistent second swipe to convince them to let go.<br /><br />Whether it's a good or a bad thing I'm not sure, but when I am out in the city the wind is almost always in my face. I feel like the truck driver in Douglas Adams' world, the one on whom it always rains, in his case because the clouds just love him so. <br /><br />Today I go to work without a book, I finished one a couple days ago, and this is the day to gather a new one. Something quick, something observational. Rather than intense, emotional, personal. Certainly nothing "experimental". Sunlight and bugginess doesn't lend itself to gravity, introspection, or experimentation.<br />Something that will let you brush off flies. Haven't you ever read a book that transfixed you, something that rooted you, rendered you impervious to physical distractions and irritations? <br />No!? <br />Then one of us here has a book you have to read.<br />Ask us next time you're in.<br /><br /><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/__XLYr0GLRDQ/S9tF4OHrkWI/AAAAAAAAAEc/dU55hEmCVio/s1600/libdandelion.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 368px;" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/__XLYr0GLRDQ/S9tF4OHrkWI/AAAAAAAAAEc/dU55hEmCVio/s400/libdandelion.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5466039404909531490" /></a>
