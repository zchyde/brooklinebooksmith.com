My fellow booksellers are used to the sight of me popping into a room, sometimes brandishing a book and sometimes not, asking the following in quick succession: “Have you heard of (author x)?&nbsp; Do you like him/her?&nbsp; Would you go to this event?”<br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Sometimes, I’m greeted with silence or a shrug.&nbsp; Other times, there’s the enthusiastic head nod accompanied by a historical overview of the author’s previous visits (<i>Confidential to Jill McCorkle</i>: The staff of Brookline Booksmith remembers you fondly), the “Squee” (<i>Confidential to Ron Currie, Jr.</i>: Yeah man, you got a squee), the “To the Internet!” (<i>Confidential to Simon Tofield of <a href="http://www.simonscat.com/" target="_blank">Simon's Cat</a></i>: Your videos are giggle-inducing and still pack a punch when shared amongst two or three booksellers huddled near a screen), or the slow dawning name recognition held within an “Oh yeeaaaah” (<i>Confidential to Author X</i>: We’re still tentative for this event, but when we get confirmed…).&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">While a lot of events for this upcoming year are still in the air, a lot of them are nailed down and ready to go.&nbsp; For you events fanatics (of which I hope there are droves), here’s a picture that might elicit a squee of your very own.&nbsp; </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0k-K5_RVB6w/UOtjRQMHI_I/AAAAAAAAAG8/r0765z4k4JY/s1600/spring2013preview.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="239" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0k-K5_RVB6w/UOtjRQMHI_I/AAAAAAAAAG8/r0765z4k4JY/s320/spring2013preview.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal">These aren’t randomly chosen books, they’re an assortment of galleys and finished books that have only one thing in common: these authors are coming to Brookline Booksmith within the next few months.&nbsp; I haven’t even started publicizing most of these people yet, but … <i>Confidential to you</i>: We have a super-public google calendar (<a href="http://brooklinebooksmith.com/googlecalendar">brooklinebooksmith.com/googlecalendar</a>) that is full of our confirmed events.&nbsp; Look at it, salivate, and know that you’re going to be near some pretty fantastic authors.&nbsp; While you’re at it, subscribe to our <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/b-mail.htm" target="_blank">B-Mail newsletter</a> so you’ll be updated with everything that’s happening here.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">If you must must know more, ask in the comments field!</div>
