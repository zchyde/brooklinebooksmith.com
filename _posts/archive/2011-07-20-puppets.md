Waiting in line to get a book signed is great...if you're&nbsp;a reader over the age of, maybe, 10.&nbsp; That's why, for the little guys, we do more than just book signings.&nbsp; I would not say that we are simply entertaining your kids, but opening their eyes to broader aspects of literature and stories.&nbsp; Check out this video from David Hyde Costello's event for<em><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781580892643"> Little Pig Joins the Band</a></em>.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOG_video_class" id="BLOG_video-cb922dc9304c86f5" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/get_player"><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"><param name="flashvars" value="flvurl=https://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?id%3Dcb922dc9304c86f5%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1451299850%26sparams%3Did,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3DA62FC4A35B6F775FFF815E736B43099B1390035B.1259584C34F43836A0BF5D059CE4FE310BDBAFD4%26key%3Dck2&amp;iurl=https://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3Dcb922dc9304c86f5%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DQuAN3gftEFaxbB-PP5XyetJIk7I&amp;autoplay=0&amp;ps=blogger"><embed src="//www.youtube.com/get_player" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="320" height="266" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" flashvars="flvurl=https://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?id%3Dcb922dc9304c86f5%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1451299850%26sparams%3Did,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3DA62FC4A35B6F775FFF815E736B43099B1390035B.1259584C34F43836A0BF5D059CE4FE310BDBAFD4%26key%3Dck2&iurl=https://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3Dcb922dc9304c86f5%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DQuAN3gftEFaxbB-PP5XyetJIk7I&autoplay=0&ps=blogger" allowFullScreen="true" /></object></div><br />No, there are no giraffes in the<em> Little Pig</em> story (but there was in <em><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780374335267">I Can Help</a></em>).&nbsp; It's quite an amazing puppet, isn't it?<br /><br />The heart of great author talks is when an author&nbsp;gives more than a simple book&nbsp;signing.<br /><br />When they talk about experiences or show other art forms they have delved in to, it gives an&nbsp;insight into their life and soul in a different way that their book could ever&nbsp;do.&nbsp; Thoughts and creative objects, such as this giraffe brought to life -- no longer confined to the page -- inspire the imagination!&nbsp;Not to mention readers and listeners as well.<br /><br />Thank you to all you wonderful authors who go beyond your written words.
