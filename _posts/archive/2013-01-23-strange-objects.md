As I was walking around today holding a host of candles in my arms, two of my fellow booksellers looked at me oddly and asked what I was doing.<br /><br />"It's for the event on Saturday." I said, thinking it was enough of an explanation.<br /><br />Blank faces looked back at me. &nbsp;I tried again. "Ian Svenonius, of Chain and the Gang? &nbsp;DJ? &nbsp;Seance? &nbsp;Saturday night?"<br /><br />"Ohhhhhh." they replied, and went on with their lives. <br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">--</div><br />It's funny how many times I'm seen with the strangest items in my arms. &nbsp;Sunday night, I had a feather in my hair and rolls of "Signed Copy" stickers in my bag as I went to our Bawdy Boston event over at the Regal Beagle. &nbsp;On Monday, I was crouched in a corner in the UBC, murmuring into a microphone to another bookseller who was in our Card and Gift Room so I could test what the sound was like upstairs. &nbsp;Oftentimes, I'm carrying a giant foamcore poster for an upcoming author event, or a box of tickets we're about to sell for one of our Coolidge events, or a stack of events flyers, or a boxcutter. &nbsp;Our events series requires a lot of ingenuity and an assortment of strange objects.<br /><br />The best strange object, though?<br /><br />Meet Godfather, the events horse, bestowed upon me by former Booksmith Zoe. &nbsp;Godfather watches over the galleys on my desk and is supported by an old Brookline Booksmith ruler. &nbsp;We've talked about Godfather doing an introduction one day, but I don't think any of us are ready for an event of that caliber.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sczKNzQXjtY/UQBpX-rUrzI/AAAAAAAAAHM/vwJHDUnbGZU/s1600/photo+(10).JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sczKNzQXjtY/UQBpX-rUrzI/AAAAAAAAAHM/vwJHDUnbGZU/s320/photo+(10).JPG" width="239" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">In addition to loving events, Godfather also loves America.&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>You might think it's strange that one has an events horse head puppet, but I think he embodies what our events series is: something lovingly given and really cool that can only be held by Brookline Booksmith.
