I have a bookseller friend who takes those moments to construct the funniest damn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram">Venn diagrams </a>you've ever seen.<br /><br />I can't wait to show him Jessica Hagy's new book <strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;initiate=yes&amp;fromauthor=yes&amp;author=6105681">Indexed</a></em></strong>. It's a HILARIOUS little compilation of graphs and diagrams that have been amusing me for days (and has me checking out <a href="http://indexed.blogspot.com/">Ms. Hagy's blog </a>for more!). Some of my favorites:<br /><br />The intersection of organ, monkey, and scared little kid? Medical miracle or street performance.<br />Big jewelry, cane, and fur coat? Rich old woman or pimp.<br /><br />And finally...<br />Father, son, and ghost? The worst camping trip ever.</div>
