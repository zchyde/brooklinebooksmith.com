I am possibly the loudest person who works at Brookline Booksmith. I talk incessantly about things I like, and if there is a book or author I'm obsessed with, you will know. I regularly attempt to give up coffee to try to curb my enthusiasm but I keep going back because I love talking with our local baristas.<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aOgO30SgT-8/UyCoPwaJXqI/AAAAAAAACoA/s9w_jqjr9Qg/s1600/pitchfork.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aOgO30SgT-8/UyCoPwaJXqI/AAAAAAAACoA/s9w_jqjr9Qg/s1600/pitchfork.jpg" height="320" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Yes, this is a pitchfork. The construction is questionable, <br />so please do not spear villagers or rampaging monsters with it.</td></tr></tbody></table>Last night we held an event for Jeremy P. Bushnell's crazy new book, <i>The Weirdness</i>. Booksellers loved it, so upon arrival he was presented with a pitchfork. Rather than run screaming from the bookstore, Jeremy was delighted that his inaugural event came with a lovingly-crafted present. Katie even used the pitchfork in her introduction to emphasize how <i>The Weirdness</i>&nbsp;"skewers the lit machine." The audience was appreciative, and I hid in the back so that I would be less likely to fist pump Katie (for such a great intro!) and Jeremy (who actually used the pitchfork!) during the event. <br /><br />While my crafting skills don't come out for every author event, I try to make sure we have events that we can all be excited about--whether it be a fledgling author, a poet we've admired for ages, or someone whose work has struck us. The more times the word 'love' is invoked, the better.
