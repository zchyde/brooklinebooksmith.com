Hi everyone,<br />This is Paul, ancient Booksmithie and newsletter writer, and Katie is just being silly.  As of the last few moments, there are now officially two posts, and Genie and Katie are standing near me talking about how more of us are going to get into the act, asap.<br /><br />Let me put some actual "content" in here:<br />I LOVE WILLIAM VOLLMANN.  And I con't care a bit about his famously questionable personal habits.  I'm reading "The Rifles" at the moment, and within one hallucinegenic page I was as enthralled as I've been by any book since I was in grade school and  opened "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" for the first time.<br /><br />Anyway, this wasn't so hard, and I'll be back on here soon.<br /><br />Blogs are great and all, but come into the store this holiday season, we miss you.<br /><br />Peace,<br />Paul
