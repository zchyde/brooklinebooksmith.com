Yesterday after work I swam home and turned on the AC and TLC....(the ladies' channel) I watched "Say Yes to the Dress" and ate some goldfish while reading poetry by Louise Gluck. I find no irony in this.<img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 154px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 177px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5494906088311157250" border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TEHT-Vvq8gI/AAAAAAAAAGI/-gsObFm9yuE/s320/1491928437_36b64cdfc5.jpg" /><br /><div><div><div>I then went on Facebook wherein I saw that my fella had taken the "I write like" test, and apparently...according to this kitschy little monstrosity....he writes like David Foster Wallace. I of course had to put in my "work" and low and behold...I too write like DFW. This got me thinking...doesn't everyone writing/ thinking in this postpostpost- modernity kinda write like DFW....in a reference rich simulacrum of conscilience? Then I found this AP article on the whole phenomena <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j93L3sF-VA-F548doKe70er5uD0wD9H0DAU81">http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j93L3sF-VA-F548doKe70er5uD0wD9H0DAU81</a><br />The little nugget about Herman Melville writing more like Steven King than himself is just delightful.</div><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 177px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 147px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5494906165797145394" border="0" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TEHUC2ZxSzI/AAAAAAAAAGQ/bCJUgrpqD2g/s320/angelina_jolie_edwin-a-salt-brad-pitt-twins-tomkat-tom-cruise-katie-holmes.jpg" /><br /><div>It brings up an interesting idea about influence. That is why when I write I like to have reality television on in the background. I like to know a lot about Angelina Jolie and Ochocinco. I think it keeps me present and keeps my brain from swimming too deeply in Lorca's duende. I think it is important that we treat all media...well....<em>most </em>media with care...and by care I mean...acknowledgment of its presence...because whether we like it or not it is here to stay...and I'd like to have a really clear idea as to what it is I am making fun of, or <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TEHUP9Kr16I/AAAAAAAAAGY/TebIGWnPVI8/s1600/chad-johnson.jpg"><img style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; WIDTH: 202px; FLOAT: right; HEIGHT: 194px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5494906390951221154" border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TEHUP9Kr16I/AAAAAAAAAGY/TebIGWnPVI8/s320/chad-johnson.jpg" /></a>criticizing...and why.</div></div></div>
