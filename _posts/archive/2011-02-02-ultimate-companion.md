As the snow piles deeper, so do the boxes of books that surround us in the back.&nbsp; It can be exciting, even when a maze of books towers just above your line of sight.&nbsp; But, what's more exciting is when those boxes contain fabulous new releases.&nbsp; Here we go, top three picturebooks of my week:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781442403772">I Must Have Bobo</a> by Eileen Rosenthal, illustrated by Marc Rosenthal<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TUnAnZ_xPyI/AAAAAAAAAN4/iRFr14s7qXw/s1600/9781442403772.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; cssfloat: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" s5="true" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TUnAnZ_xPyI/AAAAAAAAAN4/iRFr14s7qXw/s200/9781442403772.jpg" width="183" /></a></div>Even cats know that sock monkeys are the ulitmate companion.&nbsp; Earl drags Bobo, the lovely sock monkey, around everywhere.&nbsp; There's one problem.&nbsp; This monkey does NOT belong to Earl the cat.&nbsp; It is Willy's! Who else can he brave the slide with or build a block fort with?&nbsp; Was Bobo stolen by pirates again?&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; It was that rascally Earl.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780061963315">A Pet for Petunia</a> by Paul Schmid<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TUnCHOAyTVI/AAAAAAAAAN8/P8_rAQMwBSw/s1600/51kGZh4bg4L__SL500_AA300_.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; cssfloat: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" s5="true" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TUnCHOAyTVI/AAAAAAAAAN8/P8_rAQMwBSw/s200/51kGZh4bg4L__SL500_AA300_.jpg" width="200" /></a></div>Petunia likes, no, loves, loves, LOVES skunks.&nbsp; Not just her stuffed skunk who is always by her side, but a "REAL pet skunk."&nbsp; Skunks don't stink.&nbsp; They are cute!&nbsp; One day, when Petunia takes a walk through the forest, who does she find but&nbsp;a creature who is:&nbsp;"Black and white [with a] cute litle nose.&nbsp; Big black eyes. [and] Stripes."&nbsp; But why does Petunia run away...and then return back to the forest?<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781553377368">Spork</a> by Kyo Maclear, illustrated by Isabelle Arsenault<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TUnDi2pgquI/AAAAAAAAAOE/5limPsNqtdM/s1600/9781553377368.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; cssfloat: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" s5="true" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TUnDi2pgquI/AAAAAAAAAOE/5limPsNqtdM/s200/9781553377368.jpg" width="160" /></a></div>He's just a spork.&nbsp; Not a spoon, even though his mother is.&nbsp; And, he's not a fork, even though his father is.&nbsp; No matter how hard Spork tries, he can't fit in anywhere.&nbsp; "Spork wonder[s] if there were other lonely creatures out there with <strong>no matching kind</strong>, who never got chosen to be at the table."&nbsp; Will Spork ever find his place in the world and be a somebody instead of a nobody?
