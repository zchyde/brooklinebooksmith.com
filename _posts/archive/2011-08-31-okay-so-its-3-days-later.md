I don't think we even sell batteries here, or, in other words, probably about 95% of what we sell does not need electricity.&nbsp; If you have been through power outages before, or if Irene brought your first one, you know that your world vastly changes.&nbsp; By candle light and lantern, the sound of silence lingers.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; You mean no texting and FaceBook (if phones&nbsp;are out or have&nbsp;run out of battery power)?&nbsp; I can't charge up my GameBoy?&nbsp; No more re-runs on TV?&nbsp; But what to do with the hours (or possibly days) ahead?<br /><br /><em>[Dramatic gasp!]</em>&nbsp; How about a book or magazine?&nbsp; A puzzle to finger in between awkward moments of conversations that no longer involve a keypad?&nbsp; Or a game?<br /><br />Right now, I love to recommend the game "<a href="http://www.gamewright.com/gamewright/index.php?section=games&amp;page=game&amp;show=255">Flip Out</a>" for adults and&nbsp;children.<br /><br />The object of the game is to match up four cards of the same design together.&nbsp; You can see one side of your opponent's cards, but not the other.&nbsp; So as you trade, you could be benefitting or defeating your opponent.&nbsp; It seems too easy, right?&nbsp; But I assure you that once you get going it is a lot of fun. Switching, swapping, and flipping cards appears to be&nbsp;a basis for&nbsp;one great game.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KzydZ0IK0Rk/Tl7GkCapRtI/AAAAAAAAARE/hkj1qp4FRKE/s1600/flipout-600.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KzydZ0IK0Rk/Tl7GkCapRtI/AAAAAAAAARE/hkj1qp4FRKE/s320/flipout-600.jpg" width="313" xaa="true" /></a></div>Takes 2-4 players and I recommend it for children as young as 6.<br />
