I'm talking about that 7 year old book that you've never heard of, and all of a sudden a friend is raving about it....you trip over it in a used book store, or the author is referenced by another author on Oprah...that sort of thing.)<br /><br />This philosophy extends to every other area of life...in my alarmingly humble opinion.<br /><br />So I'm going to start that process- for anyone who may read this.<br /><br />Dorianne Laux is a poet. She wrote "What We Carry"...the color of my life changed after I read this book. <br /><br />Gary Lutz is a writer. He wrote "Stories in the Worst Way"...my concept of what flash fiction can do was broken open. I posit,(again in my alarmingly humble opinion), that he has created a new genre.<br /><br />Kim Addonizio is a poet. She wrote "Tell Me". I see her collection of poetry as an act of permission-giving to anyone who thought "you can't write about that, that's not poetry"....and that <em>sort of thing </em>makes for the most entertaining and accessible art.<br /><br />Now if you hear of these authors 3 more times, you are bound to buy their work...but I can save you the time...<br /><br />Dorianne Laux<br />Dorianne Laux<br />Dorianne Laux<br />Gary Lutz<br />Gary Lutz<br />Gary Lutz<br />Kim Addonizio<br />Kim Addonizio<br />Kim Addonizio<br /><br />I know it is cheating, but I'm serious. I'll take that ethical risk.<br /><br />As another point before I get back to shelving...I chose poets. For those of you who think that you don't like poetry...let me give you this. If you have a short attention span, if you like short stories, or the lace of a novel...If you love stand-up comedy...<br /><br />Poetry offers more talent and diversity than any other medium...(I'm gonna get slapped for that)<br /><br />If you don't believe me...check out our poetry section...it is swollen with funny, disturbing, fractured, amorous, academic, experimental, feminist, and humanist poets. <br /><br />And if you are a poetry lover...buy poetry. <br /><br />And if you write poetry, buy poetry.<br /><br />It is affordable...<br /><br />especially our used poetry. <br /><br /><br />how poetic.
