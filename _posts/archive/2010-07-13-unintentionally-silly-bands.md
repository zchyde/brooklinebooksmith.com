It's been a busy, understaffed day at the store today so I just have one thing to share.<br /><br />Earlier this evening I was at the cash register with a father and two sons.  Each of the sons, about 6-years-old, was being treated to a packet of "silly bands," the latest elastic-band craze to hit the youth of America.  And perhaps beyond.  This father did not check the price before he purchased the colorful elastic bands shaped like farm animals, and when the total came to $6.38 he said, with surprise in his voice, "You guys, these things cost $3 each.  Gee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">whiz</span>."<br />Without missing a beat, one of the boys made a serious face and said, quite innocently and earnestly, "That's outrageous!" He bounced on his feet and reached for the bag that contained his new toy. <br /><br />Okay, maybe you had to be there.  The dad laughed, I laughed.  I <em>promise</em> it was funny.<br /><br />Anyway, bring an umbrella.  It's raining out there. <br /><br />And oh yeah, if you're looking to buy some silly bands for yourself, avoid the local drug stores.  Ours are cheaper and we have plenty in stock!
