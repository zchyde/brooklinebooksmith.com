I'll be leaving for <a href="https://bookexpoamerica.com/App/homepage.cfm?moduleid=42&appname=288">BEA </a>in about an hour, with one suitcase packed and one empty for all the swag I'm hoping to pick up. My wish list is as follows:<br /><br /><strong><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=storepicks&amp;page=293413"><em>Plenty</em> </a>by Alisa Smith and J.B. MacKinnon</strong>: This is already available, but the authors will be there signing and I'm eager to meet them. I think this book will be a nice compliment with <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9780060852559"><em>Animal, Vegetable, Miracle</em> </a>by Barbara Kingsolver, which as previously mentioned, I fell in love with. This is also a staff pick this month from Bonnie, you can read her recommendation <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=storepicks&amp;page=293413">here</a>.<br /><br /><strong><em>Silent in the Sanctuary</em> by Deanna Raybourn</strong>: This follows Ms. Raybourn's first book, <em><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9780778324102">Silent in the Grave</a></em>. I loved that one so much that I wrote a recommendation for it that got picked for BookSense (read it <a href="https://www.booksense.com/bspicks/Jan07.jsp">here</a>)! I'm really excited to see this become a series.<br /><br /><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780312358334"><strong><em>Abstinence Teacher</em> </strong></a><strong>by Tom Perrotta</strong>: A new book by an author who needs no introduction.<br /><br />Oh hell, this is just getting too long--I have a train to catch! Others include a biography of Charles Schultz (called, easily enough, <em>Schultz & Peanuts: A Biography</em>), Jonathan Bean's solo picture book <em><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780374304461">At Night</a></em>, a novel by Brock Clarke with a great title--<em>An Arsonist's Guide to Writers' Homes in New England</em>, a compendium of great food to try called <em><a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=9780060885908">Eat This!</a></em> (as well as the new book from <a href="https://www.americastestkitchen.com/">America's Test Kitchen</a>, <em>America's Best Lost Recipes</em>), and young adult books <em>Undercover</em> by Beth Kephart and <a href="https://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780061148965"><em>My Mother the Cheerleader</em> </a>by Robert Sharenow. My love for trashy romances by Avon will be sated by new books by <a href="https://www.kathryncaskie.com/">Kathryn Caskie </a>and <a href="https://www.sophianash.com/">Sophia Nash</a>.<br /><br />I don't know whether I'll have the opportunity to blog during the madness coming up--I'll certainly try! If not, I'll be back with you either Sunday night or Monday. I need to catch you up on my appointment with my Simon &amp; Schuster rep!
