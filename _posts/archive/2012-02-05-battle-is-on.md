Superbowl, schmuperbowl.<br /><br />:Duck the angrily lobbed cheese curls of a region full of angry Patriots fans:<br /><br />Sorry. Let's start again. I hear there's an exciting game on tonight. However, personally, I'm more interested in following another competition: <em>School Library Journal</em>'s Battle of the Books.<br /><br />The concept is simple: take <a href="http://battleofthebooks.slj.com/2012/02/01/our-2012-contenders/">a bunch of kids' books</a> from the past year that had some form of "buzz." Assign brackets to some of the best authors in the business (judge list TBA). Let the games begin.<br /><br />Come on, <a href="http://brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/shoshana">Inside Out and Back Again</a>. Keep it going.
