"But the angel said to them, 'Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of  great joy that will be for all the people. Today in the town of David a  Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord.'" (Luke 2:1-11,  NIV) <br /><br />Amidst our overflowing tables of holiday and wintry books, we have  great books that focus on the nativity scene.&nbsp; Please read on the  celebration for one of the many reasons of the season.&nbsp; For all you  reluctant readers -- overly cautious on reading&nbsp;the birth of Christ -- please look  closely.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some are more involved with the traditional nativity scene  than others.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TQmXTdRzi6I/AAAAAAAAANg/UG_zpdsNRG4/s1600/a-christmas-manger.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><br /></a></div><div id="divSignature"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TQmXTdRzi6I/AAAAAAAAANg/UG_zpdsNRG4/s1600/a-christmas-manger.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TQmWo8oeseI/AAAAAAAAANc/IrOZ2ueqNM0/s1600/christmas_is_here_400.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TQmVh_YrEPI/AAAAAAAAANQ/HFHz13_yVpo/s1600/nativity.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TQmVWpfrZeI/AAAAAAAAANM/nIrbXUBulgE/s1600/51Xr5d07tBL.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TQmVBYqVcLI/AAAAAAAAANI/i0_1l2aOeR4/s1600/The-Christmas-Miracle-of-Jonathan-Toomey-with-CD-Gift-Edition-0763636290-L.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763636296"><i>The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey</i></a> by Susan Wojciechowski&nbsp; <br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TQmVBYqVcLI/AAAAAAAAANI/i0_1l2aOeR4/s1600/The-Christmas-Miracle-of-Jonathan-Toomey-with-CD-Gift-Edition-0763636290-L.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TQmVBYqVcLI/AAAAAAAAANI/i0_1l2aOeR4/s200/The-Christmas-Miracle-of-Jonathan-Toomey-with-CD-Gift-Edition-0763636290-L.jpg" width="167" /></a>For those of you who know the nativity story in and out, try this one  out.&nbsp; You won't be disappointed. Thomas is seven and knows exactly how  his nativity set looked -- the beloved set was lost in a recent move.&nbsp;  However, the best wood carver in town is always "mumbling and  grumbling,muttering and sputtering, grumping and griping."&nbsp; Will Thomas  get his sheep that look happy? A cow that is proud? And, "'Jesus [...]  smiling&nbsp; and reaching up to his mother.'"? <br /><br />This edition is also available in a gorgeous P.J. Lynch <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763643799">box set</a> and includes a fabulous audio cd read by James Earl Jones.&nbsp; <br /><br /><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763649968"><i>Great Joy</i></a> by Kate DiCamillo <br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TQmVWpfrZeI/AAAAAAAAANM/nIrbXUBulgE/s1600/51Xr5d07tBL.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TQmVWpfrZeI/AAAAAAAAANM/nIrbXUBulgE/s200/51Xr5d07tBL.jpg" width="171" /></a>Frances is a very thoughtful child.&nbsp; The organ grinder on the street,  along with his monkey, are homeless in the bitter cold and snowfall. No  else, except for young Frances,&nbsp;has thought to invite this man  anywhere.&nbsp; Newbery author, Kate&nbsp;DiCamillo, inspires readers to share a  real spirit of the holidays -- compassion.&nbsp; With this, along with the  words and acrylic gouache paintings, Frances does indeed show how great  Joy can light up a room and a life.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780152060855"><i>Nativity</i></a> by Julie Vivas <br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TQmVh_YrEPI/AAAAAAAAANQ/HFHz13_yVpo/s1600/nativity.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TQmVh_YrEPI/AAAAAAAAANQ/HFHz13_yVpo/s200/nativity.jpg" width="200" /></a>Tattered clothes, a very pregnant lady, and angels in army boots?&nbsp; I  love, love, LOVE this version of Christ's coming.&nbsp; The bright  illustrations reflect an overflowing inn, Mary and Joseph as ordinary  humans, angels as warriors on a mission -- not cute little things with  fluffy wings -- and people full of curiosity.&nbsp; Join the celebration in  the birth of the Savior.&nbsp; The text focus on Luke chapter 2, with no  nonsense, even though the illustrations will bring many smiles and  laughs.&nbsp; <br /><br /><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780762440047"><i>Charlie Brown Christmas Pop-Up</i></a> <b><span style="color: blue;">NEW</span></b> <br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TQmV01EOgkI/AAAAAAAAANU/ZMreEReAgD0/s1600/charliebrwon.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="188" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TQmV01EOgkI/AAAAAAAAANU/ZMreEReAgD0/s200/charliebrwon.jpg" width="200" /></a>The text remains faithful to the 30 minute short that plays every year  on TV, or it might even be on DVD (perhaps VHS, too)&nbsp;in your very own  living room.&nbsp; Now, it's not quite the same effect, but it is a great  pop-up to walk around with Charlie Brown again and hear Linus recalling  what Christmas is about.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780064402750"><i>Best Christmas Pageant Eve</i></a>r by Barbara Robinson <br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TQmWCYeoeXI/AAAAAAAAANY/ihfsEAC7gss/s1600/christmas+p.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TQmWCYeoeXI/AAAAAAAAANY/ihfsEAC7gss/s200/christmas+p.jpg" width="134" /></a>"The first pageant rehearsal was usually about as much fun as a  three-hour ride on the school bus, and just as noisy and crowded. This  rehearsal, though, was different. Everybody shut up and settled down  right away, for fear of missing something awful that the Herdmans might  do."<br /><br />The Herdmans are the bullies of all bullies!&nbsp; So, what are they doing at  the first Christmas pageant practice at the local church?&nbsp; And, what will they do first? Beat everyone up before the performance, burn the church down, or steal from the offering plate again?&nbsp; Even though this book focuses on an  important holiday for Christians, it is in no way overly-religious.&nbsp;  I'll just say that it was first read to me out loud in second grade, at a  very public elementary school.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781442408227"><i>Christmas is Here</i></a> illustrated by Lauren Castillo&nbsp;<span style="color: blue;">NEW </span><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TQmWo8oeseI/AAAAAAAAANc/IrOZ2ueqNM0/s1600/christmas_is_here_400.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TQmWo8oeseI/AAAAAAAAANc/IrOZ2ueqNM0/s200/christmas_is_here_400.jpg" width="200" /></a>A boy&nbsp;stops by an outdoor nativity, looking intently at baby Jesus.&nbsp;  Readers are soon sprung into the story of the shepherds hearing the  message from the angels that Christ the Savior is born.&nbsp; I really like  this picturebook because it is not over taken by ridiculous extras or  overt cuteness.&nbsp; It is simply the text from Luke 2:8-14, taken from the  New King James translation.&nbsp; The illustrations work to&nbsp;mirror the text  in a way that focuses your attention on what is really happening.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780547238944"><i>A Christmas Manger</i></a> by H.A.
