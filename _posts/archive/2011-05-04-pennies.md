To some, Remainders (aka, our&nbsp;Bargain Books) mean discounts, to some it is an affordable piece of literature beyond our Used Book Cellar, to others they are a continuation of a great selection of books. And, that is the beauty of them. So many great titles!&nbsp; Right now we have a few of&nbsp;our regular bestsellers: <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316007627">Shark vs Train</a>&nbsp;($7.99)</em>, <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780786838837">Clementine</a>&nbsp;($2.99)</em>, <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780312602383">The Girl Who Could Fly</a>&nbsp;($2.99)</em>, <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780061715174">My Garden</a>&nbsp;($7.99)</em>, <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780061857782">Good Day</a></em> ($7.99), <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316563369">Lost</a></em> ($2.99),&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316118255">Wabi Sabi</a></em> ($7.99), <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781599900735">Princess Academy</a></em> ($3.99), <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781449402327">Big Nate From the Top</a></em> ($4.99),&nbsp;and a wide array of Curious George books and stickerbooks.&nbsp; Often times, we'll get books in here that you would normally have to special order: <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780393057744">Annotated Wind in the Willows</a></em> ($14.99), <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780393020397">Annotated Huckleberry Finn</a></em> ($14.99), <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780375833663">The Me Book</a></em> ($3.99), as well as hardcover copies of variousness.<br /><br />I love watching people browse over this table, not having to worry about the price, as the loose ends and aftermath&nbsp;of the recession still remain.&nbsp; I'm probably drifting on a cloud here...I mean my shoulders clench when people think everything should be discounted because we are a part of the GenMe world.&nbsp; Yet, I prefer to think Remainders close the gap between people with an $5 extra dollars to spend a month, with readers who can drop hundreds a week.&nbsp; That is a wonderful part of literature.&nbsp; No matter your background or opinion, there's always something there to debate, discuss, or ponder.&nbsp; Varying views expand the small pages we live, and words are what thread them together.
