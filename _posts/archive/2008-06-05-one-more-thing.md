<img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5208538856879520898" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zqgb4FOCazQ/SEhyfosffII/AAAAAAAAAG4/QekM-iuchxQ/s320/prince.bmp" border="0" />I didn't get to go to <a href="https://www.bookexpoamerica.com/">BEA </a>this year (Book Expo, the book world's huge trade show/carnival) as it was in California which was a bit of a bummer. I'm pretty much over it at this point but there is one thing I am still regretting...I missed out on a private party/concert by Prince. <a href="https://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/02/princes-late-night-at-book-expo/#more-501">AT HIS HOUSE!!!</a><br /><br />I saved my invitation just the same.
