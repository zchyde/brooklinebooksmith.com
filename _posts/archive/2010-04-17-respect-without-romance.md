Mostly I don't have the cash, and there is something that feels transient about the experience, I can take so many pictures that it would border compulsion, each one meaning less and less....<br /></div><div>the other reason is--- I have a monster fear of losing pictures that I love...<br /></div><div>...that's why I still use film (120) and use the hardiest, cheapest camera out there...the holga.<br /></div><div>I don't chose to use film because it is kitchy and urban outfitters broadcasts the hipness of lomography with their overpriced film section...<br /></div><div>I don't romanticise old technologies simply because they are old... I use them because I know that it is important that the tradition live on casually somewhere...and they force my frantic brain to settle down, and focus on taking one good shot.<br /></div><div>I have to keep the compulsion to collect, accrue and consume in check.<br /><br /></div><div></div><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 286px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 281px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5461169101196260258" border="0" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/S8n4XO8kc6I/AAAAAAAAACg/BHB8VCqswX4/s320/coolidge.jpg" /><br /><br /><div>Friends have told me about holga &amp; poloroid apps on their iphones- and that's great....(feels cheap but whatever it looks great.) The reason it wouldn't cut it for me is because the <em>process</em> is lost. I want that slowness. It's good for me.</div><br /><div>I'm resisting running the parallel of ink to page ....and ebooks to book-books, and bookstores....(That's another post)...but I think you can image the lines I'd draw. One line...when all the data is corrupted and the servers go down- how will the future be sure this wasn't a dark age?</div><br /><div></div><br /><div>Mostly- I want to understand how things age...how their purpose changes, how we make meaning of things, how meaning is made of us... how obsolescence changes the way we view the medium...</div><br /><div></div><br /><div>Mostly I'm protective ...when it gets old...and other people are throwing it away...I love it more.</div><div></div><div></div><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 403px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 385px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5461171199661997298" border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/S8n6RYVyfPI/AAAAAAAAAC4/94-LnIm4cuM/s320/holgamans.bmp" /><br />© Kate Robinson 2010</div></div></div>
