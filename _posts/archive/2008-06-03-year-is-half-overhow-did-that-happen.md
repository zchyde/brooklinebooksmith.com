So I could share with you (and remind myself!) of what I've been reading I started a couple lists...now I just have to make sure I keep them updated!<br /><br />I've been so busy with rep appointments and I want to share all the awesome books coming soon, but it might have to wait for a bit...which will be good as it will give me a chance to go through the catalogs again to remind me of what's coming!<br /><br />A fall book from Simon and Schuster that I already finished and loved is <strong><em>French Milk</em></strong> by <a href="http://www.stoppayingattention.com/">Lucy Knisley</a>. It's a graphic novel travelogue of a month in Paris with her mother. Honestly, I'll be upfront about the fact that there's no real storyline or character development, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself and when I was done reading I felt that:<br /><br />A. I want to go to Paris with my mom<br />B. I want to go to Paris with Lucy Knisley<br />C. I want to go to Paris with Lucy Knisley's mom<br />D. Actually, I'll take any of the above.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure why I liked this book so much since, with few exceptions, I'm not a big fan of graphic novels (I know, I'm a traitor to my generation). Jessica over at <a href="http://writtennerd.blogspot.com/">The Written Nerd </a>is a graphic novel whiz/aficionado and has offered me suggestions in the past, but they never took. Maybe it's because this is so simple--a journal of daily visits to the museums, restaurants, and shops. Maybe it's because my favorite things in the world are museums, restaurants, and shops. Or maybe it's just that the snoop in me really appreciated that I got to read someone's diary.<br /><br /><strong>Related Notes</strong>:<br /><p>The only other graphic novels I've really gotten into are by Jeffrey Brown (his most recent is <strong><em><a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781416549468">Little Things</a></em></strong>). Apparently I really like my graphic novels as autobiographical petit fours. </p>Perhaps it is not surprising that I enjoyed the book <a href="http://brookline.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9780465027811"><strong><em>Snoop: What Your Stuff Says About You</em></strong> </a>by Sam Gosling.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Unrelated Note</strong>:<br /><br />Apparently <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/?xrail">The Book Bench</a>, the <em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/">New Yorker</a>'s</em> book blog has linked to me. First thought: Wow! Second thought: Why? I'm not very good at articulating why I like the books I do, I'm a horrible writer, and I ignore this thing for stretches of inimitable length. Perhaps this means I need to step up my game. Or this means I will not long be linked with such estimable company. Time will tell.
