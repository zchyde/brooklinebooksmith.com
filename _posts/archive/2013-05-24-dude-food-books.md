One of them that I'm particularly excited about is&nbsp;Daniel Vaughnâ€™s <i>Prophets of Smoked Meat,</i>&nbsp;which is a full-color photo-rich book that is basically a travel guide to all the best barbecue in Texas. Also, that is a great title. And what better sort of book to give this time of year with graduations and Father's Day abounding, dads and grads alike need 1) books on how to feed the people that like them and 2) summer is around the corner and we have a duty, as friends of people with spatulas, grills or plane tickets to Texas, to perpetuate tasty meat consumption. Also, <a href="http://franklinbarbecue.com/">Franklin Barbecue </a>forever.<br /><br />Other books to try might be:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>&nbsp;<i>Grilling Vegan Style</i> by Jon Schlimm. Everyone loves a versatile chef!<br /><br /><i>Beer Lovers New England</i> by Norman Miller. Think local with your gustatory travel ideas. And also think about what hops pair best with grilled meats.<br /><br /><i>Titus Andronicus </i>by&nbsp;William Shakespeare. No recipes here, but plenty of meaty humor.<br /><br />And if you need more gifty ideas for dads or grads, "pork loin is my jam," says Jes of the Card and Gift Room when asked what meat is best.
