This may sound like a no-brainer for most people, but most people didn't grow up in a family whose parents had medals and race posters from their four or five 26.2-milers a piece decorating the walls of their house.

Somehow, I knew I would have to find my own ways to be brave.&nbsp; <div style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;"><br /></div><div style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;">My older sister is different.

And when she and her husband turned 30 last year, they decided that to celebrate, they would hike the Appalachian Trail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;"><br /></div><div style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;">The pleasures of armchair travel are many. Reading can not only take you to the places you long to go, but into experiences you never in your life would try outside of the covers of a book. Perhaps it’s the nature of the middle child to live vicariously through a more adventuresome older sibling. Maybe this ability to imagine myself into my sister’s shoes is what made me into such an avid armchair traveler...</div><div style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;"><br /></div><div style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;">Read the rest of this post at <a href="http://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/">globecorner.com</a>.</div>
