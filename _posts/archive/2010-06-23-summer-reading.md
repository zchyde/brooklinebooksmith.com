Summer reading for the Brookline schools is well under way!  This year we have more titles than ever, for grades pre-kindergarten through high school.  Even if you don't have a child in a Brookline school, these books are all wonderful reads.  (We will be carrying selected summer reading titles for other schools as well.)  If I had all the time in the world, I would read this entire <a href="https://www.brookline.k12.ma.us/teaching+and+learning/libraries/">list</a>.  Really!  Both the required for grades 3 and up, plus the hundreds of recommended titles.  The librarians, teachers, and staff really picked out some fabulous titles -- new and old -- this year!<br /><br />Our summer reading section is separated out by grades, so browsing should be no problem.  Need a picturebook?  Come look through our K-2 picturebook shelf.  Need a non-fiction book for a ten year old, come flip through our 5-6 nonfiction section.  Want to read a great young adult novel or adult fiction,  but don't know where to start?  Come look at our wall of 7th, 8th, and high school recommends.  This year's high school theme is "Finding My Voice", stories of immigration.<br /><br />And if you're still overwhelmed on what to read first, close your eyes, reach for a book, pull it out, and start reading (with your eyes back open of course!).<br /><br />Read the summer heat away.  By the way, did we ever we mention our store has great air conditioning? <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TCH_4O7hjAI/AAAAAAAAADw/Z4VvlFR3mtQ/s1600/girlinhammock1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 160px;" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_88jO9uLLIi8/TCH_4O7hjAI/AAAAAAAAADw/Z4VvlFR3mtQ/s320/girlinhammock1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5485947162659490818" border="0" /></a>
