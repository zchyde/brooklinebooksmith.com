So the last part, the missing piece as regards getting ready for my trip and books is what to bring with me! I've got a 16 hour flight (both ways) and various train rides during the trip during which I will think to myself "I really should read right now," but be too nervous-excited to do so. As travel lit guru Jodie said after her recent return from a trip, "You always think you'll read more than you actually do." Too true, and I have many trips' experience with which to back this notion up. BUT GUYS THIS TIME I'M REALLY GOING TO READ A LOT.<br /><br />Because I've found the perfect book.<br /><br /><ul><li>It's 3 books in 1, ergo a great length.</li><li>It's Scandinavian (I won't need to read about Japan while I'm there, right?)</li><li>According, again to Jodie, it's a fairy easy read with romance and history (perfect for a vacation, right?)</li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2b-V6Q6VPL8/UfVnbsbzaTI/AAAAAAAABWo/dGovT3tuxzw/s1600/kristinlav-thumb-300x400-51764.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2b-V6Q6VPL8/UfVnbsbzaTI/AAAAAAAABWo/dGovT3tuxzw/s200/kristinlav-thumb-300x400-51764.jpg" width="150" /></a></div><div>What could this perfect mystery book be the photo of which you saw as soon as you loaded the blog post? Sigrid Undset's mega-Norwegian-medieval epic <i>Kristin Lavransdatter</i>!&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't have the mega cool 3-volume edition Jodie snagged from the Used Book Cellar, but I have the new translation from Penguin all in a tidy volume, so my unbridled optimism tells me that this is the trip that I finally finish this book I've been meaning to read for years.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>As I learned with my last airplane trip in which I started <i>Cloud Atlas</i>, and promptly finished on the T-ride, the trick to reading a lot of a book on a trip is perhaps to start before you go, so you can carry that momentum over lands and oceans. So I've read through ALL my to-read pile and am currently on the last book before Kristin, so I'll have a good head start before I leave and will for surely finish it finally just as I descend back into Logan at the end of the month. Right?&nbsp;</div>
