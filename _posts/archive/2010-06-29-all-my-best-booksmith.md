On Friday, one month shy of two years, I'm leaving the Brookline Booksmith. In mid-July, I'll start working at the Boston Phoenix as their newest staff writer.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm so, so grateful to have worked for such a wonderful place. When I started here in 2008, newly relocated from Chicago, nothing in my experience could have prepared me for the dedication of the staff or our customers. Seeing Dana in action is like nothing else. To spend five minutes with her is to understand how the Booksmith thrives when so many other independents have shut their doors. This is to say nothing of the rest of the staff. I've never worked anywhere else where everyone cared so much about what they were doing. I'm very proud to call my coworkers friends. </div><div><br /></div><div>When my boyfriend came to pick me up for the first time, his jaw literally dropped open. "I've never seen so many people lining up to buy books," he said. Come think of it, neither had I.</div><div><br /></div><div>With any luck, I'll see you all around. I intend to be an extremely regular customer. I would like everyone to know how happy getting to know you has made me and what a wonderful introduction to Boston this has been. </div>
