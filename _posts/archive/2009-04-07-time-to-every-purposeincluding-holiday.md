It was in one sitting, on the train between Detroit and Chicago, and now that I think about it I'm surprised by how many of the chapters (each based around a major Jewish holiday or event) I can still clearly remember. Professor <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Sarna</span> writes in what I would call a wise-but-not-overbearing style (it's a very tricky thing!) and I felt like he was really speaking to me and the exact questions and struggles I've had about what I want to believe and how I want to live and behave as a young Jew in the 21st century--for example, questions about identity, the environment, social justice, and Israel. Stuff like this--meaty and without being <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">didactic</span>--is rare and welcome!<br /></div><div></div>
