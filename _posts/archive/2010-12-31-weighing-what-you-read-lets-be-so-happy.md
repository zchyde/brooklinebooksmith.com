The thoughts that followed were the predictable Rube Goldberg-ing of my self image down the rabbit hole zeitgeist that has been the cultural moment of Hannah Montana, the death of two Brazilian supermodels from anorexia, and let us not forget Natalie Portman in Black Swan.<br /><br />In short, I felt fat. Well, let's be honest... I am fat. My instinct when I re-remember my size in late December is to buy a crappy magazine detailing all the ways I can become someone else...the obvious...the <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">eat less move more</span> platitudes. Well, this year....I'm calling bullshit on that impulse.<br /><br />Let's look at the facts:<br /><br />I love my job.<br />I love my school.<br />I love my friends.<br />I love my family. (mostly)<br />I love my fella.<br />I have run (not walked mind you) 3 marathons while fitting into Lane Bryant's finery.<br /><br />So why then, do I have to have a private meltdown every January about my waist to hip ratio? (With my luck a Doctor is reading this and preparing a comment with a litany of HORRIFYING studies detailing just how damn important that particular ratio is but I'll take my chances)<br /><br />My life is pretty full, and so are my spanx. Must they be opposed?<br /><br />So, for 2011................................................................................inhale......<br /><br />I'm done giving my money to magazines that profit off of me feeling less than. I'm done giving my money to authors who want to sell me something that can't be sold.<br /><br />This year, the only diet I am going on is a financial one. The money I spend on books will be books I want to read. Books that nourish and challenge me. Books and magazines that actually offer something. More Muriel Rukeyser!!!! (lots of her, and other size friendly feminists in our poetry section) </p><p>No more of the vapid glossy plateau- busting simulacrums that have repeated themselves for the last 40 years. I am going to spend my money locally, and only at stores that sell a size 14....(the new average for ladies in this here country.) I am going to buy local in season foods, from local farmers, local merchants. I am going to ignore national chains of most ilks. They make their money when we are fat and sad.<br /><br /><br />So, to all my chubby brethren, I say let us be strong this year, and be satisfied with what we have this very moment. Let us be so damn happy. If dropping 80 lbs is part of that, that's fine, but ....let's seek that change in a positive key. Let's love ourselves healthier. Let's buy books we <em>want</em> to read, clothes we look amazing in, food we love. Let's start that <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">now</span>. Not after we finish "ironically reading" a SELF magazine checklist written by a 21 year old intern who lives on a diet of Yogi tea and Fiber one.<br /><br /><br />...and to all my skinny cousins out there...perhaps this year you can resolve to treat yourself better as well...<br /><br />...and if you are one of those people who already treats yourself and your cat to posh designer everythings...then...maybe this year you can challenge yourself to find beauty in diversity. Read, live and love a outside of your comfort zone... (us fatties do it all the time!!!)<br /><br />All my love to anyone who gave me their precious time to read this little rant. Happy New Year to everyone...just as you are.<br /><br /></p>
