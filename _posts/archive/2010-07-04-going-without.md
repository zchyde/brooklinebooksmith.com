I want to add spice to my traveling routine by alternating between a bicycle and a scooter. I want to have a little girl-- and not worry about what TV personality is telling her she's too fat, she's too poor. I want to work with my hands and make bread, grow herbs, brush horses, nail boards. I would love to live this way for--oh let's say...a weekend.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 258px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 188px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5490086067332369202" border="0" alt="" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TDC0MMWqyzI/AAAAAAAAAFY/hnrKT7dC-DA/s320/PCU3485.jpg" /><br /><br /><br />Then I want cable. I want heated water and the warming blue-glow of the Internet Explorer. I want to blow dry the kink out of my bangs. I want to let my fancy toothbrush do its fine job. I want to fall asleep to the sweet white noise of the cartoon network.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Amish I creepily stalked this weekend in Intercourse/ Bird in Hand Pennsylvania were a thing of majesty to me. I crept up beside a gaggle of teens in three buggies parked at Costco...and took photos of their cavity filled horses. I scanned the internet looking for information on the oh-so exotic sounding "Rumpsringa"---or the Amish answer to the middle-class "undergraduate experience." <a href="https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2002/may/amish/">https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2002/may/amish/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 244px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 172px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5490087409017593938" border="0" alt="" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TDC1aShWoFI/AAAAAAAAAFg/QNycao9s83U/s320/devilsplayground.jpg" />I guess we all want to get out of wherever we are for a bit. We count down the days till the arrival of whatever our employer deems to be our Sabbath. It is easy to romanticize the idea of reading by candlelight in a dress you know will fit, and not having to think about how it looks.<br /><br />Then remember how delicious it is to choose what you are reading, where you are reading, and why. I curled up last night with a copy of "Fancy Beasts" (a challenging and brisssssk poetry collection by Alex Lemon) <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/apachesolr_search/fancy+beasts"><span style="font-size:78%;">https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/apachesolr_search/fancy+beasts</span></a> and my energy efficient light bulb. I cranked on my energy-saver air conditioning and drifted off into a comfortable, modern, convenient sleep.<br /><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 211px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 298px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5490090026101486002" border="0" alt="" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TDC3yn6xsbI/AAAAAAAAAFw/HGaYd5geRIg/s320/9781571314437.jpg" />
