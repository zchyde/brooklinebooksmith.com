Sometimes it works the other way around: a publicist will approach me about an author I'm not familiar with, I'll set something up, they'll send me the book and I'll love it. <br /><br />Such was the case with Brady Udall. To say I loved <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780393062625">The Lonely Polygamist</a></span> is a bit of an understatement. In fact, I am fully confident that it is a work of rare novelistic genius.<br /><br />I will admit I was drawn to this book because it is about polygamist fundamentalist Mormons. Ever since reading Jon Krakauer's book <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781400032808">Under the Banner of Heaven</a></span>, I have been enthralled by polygamy, Joseph Smith, and special underwear. And then Big Love happened, and soon became my second-favorite TV show of all time (first place: Six Feet Under).<br /><br />Needless to say I was pumped when I read a title with "polygamist" in it. I was a little scared, too. Polygamy seems like it would be a tough subject to tackle, even if, like Brady Udall, you grew up in the Mormon church and spent a couple years living on a polygamist compound doing research.<br /><br />My fears were for naught. This book is ridiculously great. It's a weird, terrific pastiche of John Irving, Cormac McCarthy, Katherine Dunn, Joy Williams, and Shelley Jackson's grossly under-appreciated novel <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780060882365"><span style="font-style:italic;">Half Life</span></a>. It's funny how the best books reduce me to the stupidest cliches. I laughed and I cried. The characters were so real! Some of these scenes will stay with me forever. <br /><br />The "official" reviews aren't out yet, but <a href="https://villagebooksblogs.typepad.com/village_books_blog/2010/03/the-lonely-polygamist.html">advance buzz</a> is promising. I'd like to see someone try to tell me this book isn't great. I'd recommend <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lonely Polygamist</span> to those who like any of the following: Mormons, feelings and books.
