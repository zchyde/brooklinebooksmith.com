“It’s not down on any map—the true places never are.”<br />(Herman Melville, Moby Dick)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-b5_txuX6UK4/Uj3he5_rk1I/AAAAAAAAAxs/O9HMfNj1DYs/s1600/IMG_9041.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-b5_txuX6UK4/Uj3he5_rk1I/AAAAAAAAAxs/O9HMfNj1DYs/s320/IMG_9041.JPG" width="320" /></a></div>A  job offer in Minneapolis kept me busy this weekend, scouring ads for a  new apartment and packing up the old. But in the midst of the whirlwind  such a transition kicks up, I paused preparations for a final pilgrimage  in Boston.<br /><br />My destination was not marked on any map that I could  find, and in the end I left my apartment on foot with a backpack of  picnic snacks, a pen and notebook, but no map. I was determined to find  the base of what I call my <a data-mce-href="http://brooklinebooksmith.blogspot.com/2013/05/to-go-or-not-to-go.html" href="http://brooklinebooksmith.blogspot.com/2013/05/to-go-or-not-to-go.html">“fairy tower,”</a> a mysterious white spire topped with a sea green turret that chases me  on my walks to work and dodges and dances on the horizon each evening  when I return home. I have seen that tower from every point in this  city, but have never found it.<br /><br />As I left my apartment in Jamaica  Plain, I peered anxiously at the horizon, waiting for my goal to appear  in front of me. Usually it would show up, slightly to  the right of Stop n’ Shop, hovering over the Jackson Square T station.  Today it was gone.<br /><br data-mce-bogus="1" /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-U7glv8nDkSA/Uj3k0zrSGDI/AAAAAAAAAx4/4qn4vTJZEE4/s1600/IMG_9042.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-U7glv8nDkSA/Uj3k0zrSGDI/AAAAAAAAAx4/4qn4vTJZEE4/s320/IMG_9042.JPG" width="320" /></a>“When the rainbow disappears, the leprechauns still remain,” my husband, companion for the trek, mystifyingly assured me.<br /><br />And  he was right. We followed the Southwest Corridor Parkway around the  corner of Jackson<br />Station, and there was the tower, perched high on an  embankment of houses and autumn-tinted trees, with no clear path leading  to the top.<br /><br />Keeping our goal in sight, we crossed the traffic of  Columbus and came to a stop: a Y in the road. We chose to go left,  though soon we were cutting right on a series of labyrinthine  switchbacks that led us up the hill, past haunting mansions in decrepit  states of disrepair, and a life-size, slightly creepy statue of Christ  perched on a large rock at the corner of an empty lot, hands  outstretched as if to bless our pilgrimage.<br /><br />As we climbed higher,  now and then I would catch views of the city and surrounding  neighborhoods: the Prudential and John Hancock buildings marking  downtown, the white blight of the Vet’s hospital I pass every day on my  way to Brookline, the dome of the abandoned church down the street from  my apartment. The monuments of my life in Boston were beginning to shift  behind me, uprooting from their chronological anchors in my habitual  every day to move on the tides of elusive memory.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-q-zePNUNZVE/Uj3k96gLA_I/AAAAAAAAAyA/WckZ9JMmQwg/s1600/IMG_9050.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-q-zePNUNZVE/Uj3k96gLA_I/AAAAAAAAAyA/WckZ9JMmQwg/s320/IMG_9050.JPG" width="240" /></a></div>Soon  after we passed Jesus, the tower appeared around a bend, first its  bleached trunk with winking slits of windows, then its whole, but we  still had to climb a steep bank of sharp rocks to reach our goal,  finally firmly rooted in the center of a green square.<br /><br />As I circled  the tower I craned my neck, trying to see into the dark windows beneath  its peak. A seagull flew by, perhaps with a message for a captive  princess in its beak, but the windows kept their secrets, reflecting  only the cloud-dappled sky. We sat down to our picnic fare beneath a  weeping willow crying the golden tears of autumn. I knew I had come to  say goodbye.<br /><br />In life there are no maps, only the ever-shifting  unknowable future. But that future is anchored in place, in destinations  which we can come to know and love for the moment that we inhabit  them—or is it that they inhabit us, because even as I set out on my next  journey, I feel this place inside of me; Boston now a captive of my  memory.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-03AUtdHcA00/Uj3lH0KdMcI/AAAAAAAAAyI/wrtJwpa3zTU/s1600/IMG_8913.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-03AUtdHcA00/Uj3lH0KdMcI/AAAAAAAAAyI/wrtJwpa3zTU/s320/IMG_8913.JPG" width="320" /></a></div>And because you still need maps to most places, we’ll still have a vibrant travel section at Booksmith to  help you get to your next destination.
