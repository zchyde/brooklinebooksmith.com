If you know my writing, you might even say I'm obsessed with it.  Oh, I love the sun too, but rain cannot sing the same way sun rays or birds can.<br /> <br />During this past week's storm I wanted nothing more than to listen to the music of the rain snapping against the window and read through my to-be-read piles.  Why?  Because the symphony of rhyme and rhythm falling in the rain is the perfect background for long reads -- and quick ones, too.<br /> <br /><blockquote> <br />April Rain Song<br /> <br />Let the rain kiss you.<br />Let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops.<br />Let the rain sing you a lullaby.<br /><br />The rain makes still pools on the sidewalk.<br />The rain makes running pools in the gutter.<br />The rain plays a little sleep-song on our roof at night --<br /><br />And I love the rain.<br /><br />--Langston Hughes</blockquote>
