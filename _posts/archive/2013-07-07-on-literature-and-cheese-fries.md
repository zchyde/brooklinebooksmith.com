<span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">"It's ok though!" I remember my classmate reassuring our poetics professor. "I read Twilight, but then I read Shakespeare. I read New Moon, but then I made myself read Emily Dickinson before moving on to Eclipse. I always read a book I should read before one I want to read. It balances out."</span><br /><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">My professor (one of the most formidably intelligent and utterly terrifying individuals I've ever had the privilege to work with) cast a pained glance over the class (each of us mentally cursing our colleague's ballsy and potentially heretical bout of honesty).</span><br /><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">"But that's <i>tragic.</i>" She wrung her hands. "You're treating literature like... <i>vitamins</i>."</span><br /><span style="color: #222222;"></span><br /><span style="color: #222222;"></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: small;">Such is the horror of those demi-gods and goddesses who have never wrestled with what constitutes a guilty pleasure. They genuinely enjoy exercise and&nbsp;opera. They don't own sweatpants. Cheeseburgers gross them out - they don't understand why you wouldn't prefer green tea and a&nbsp;salad.</span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color: #222222;"><br /><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: x-small;">﻿</span><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; font-family: arial; font-size: small; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Domenico_Fetti_-_Portrait_of_a_Scholar_-_WGA07862.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Domenico_Fetti_-_Portrait_of_a_Scholar_-_WGA07862.jpg" width="238" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Scholar Dude likes candlelit dinners, long walks on the beach, and never seeing movie adaptations of classic literature.</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: small;">I have good news, America. It's not us versus them. Those luminous pillars of humanity have no more right to organic smoothies and Rilke than you do. Smoothies are good! Rilke is good! Cheese fries and Stephen King are also good!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: small;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: small;">For my part, I've been burning through the essays and short fiction of David Foster Wallace lately. Maybe I have a vitamin deficiency that's got me craving acerbic wit and frustrated optimism. Maybe I just love his writing. Maybe you would too.</span></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>
