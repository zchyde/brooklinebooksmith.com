<div><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 424px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 274px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5595892297922916386" border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NaaVSf3kQds/TaiaZYsKMCI/AAAAAAAAAO4/vtdPNN0Pd7w/s400/12222222222222222222.bmp" /> I stood outside in what was potentially sunburn weather in my Vibram 5 fingers, next to <a href="http://www.chrismcdougall.com/">Christopher McDougall.</a> He was wearing carpenters pants, and his trademark black leather 5-fingers, (his black tie choice). In between fans, I was able to ask him a few questions, and luckily he's a super nice guy, and humored me.</div><br /><div></div><br /><div><em>below was our conversation</em></div><br /><div><em></em></div><br /><div><em></em><em></em><em>me:</em> So what are you reading now? What are some of your favorite books?</div><br /><div></div><br /><div><em>CMD:</em> Definitely <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780452295292">City of Thieves</a></em>, WWII resistance history, <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780312369125">Until Proven Innocent</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781400064168">Unbroken</a></em>, and the new release <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781439100189"><em>Supercooperators.</em></a> Also <em><a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780679737094">Mating</a></em>.</div><br /><div></div><br /><div><em>me:</em> What are you working on now? Are you allowed to tell me?</div><br /><div></div><br /><div><em>CMD: </em>Technically, NO...but because you guys pushed this book before it was even a book I'll tell you. Promise not to tell everyone please. I'm working on **************** **** ******* ********. (I can tell you this. It's going to be amazing. I'm so happy he's writing another book.)</div><br /><div></div><br /><div><em>me:</em> So, when this new book comes out you ARE COMING HERE FIRST, right?</div><br /><div></div><br /><div><em>CDM: </em>I'll be there with donuts and coffee. Before the books even get there.</div><br /><div></div><br /><div><em>me:When do you plan on running your next Ultra? </em></div><br /><div></div><br /><div><em></em><em>CDM: I just ran a 50K two weeks ago in Darlington Maryland. I am running a midnight marathon in Gaza, for the children of Gaza through <a href="http://www.unrwa.org/etemplate.php?id=952">UNRWA</a>.</em></div><br /><div><em></em></div><br /><div><em></em><em>Guy getting his book signed: Do you have any inspirational quotes for runners? What minimalist shoes do you recommend? </em></div><br /><div></div><br /><div><em></em><em>CDM: "When in doubt, relax." Check out <a href="http://lunasandals.com/sandals">Barefoot Ted's site</a>. It's the Tarajumara sandals. After that, New Balance, Evo, and Neo, Vibram 5 fingers, specifically the <a href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/Five-Fingers-Bikila-Womens.htm">BIKILA</a></em> </div><br /><div></div><br /><div><em></em><em>me: Do you still have a relationship with Caballo and Barefoot Ted? </em></div><br /><div></div><br /><div><em></em><em>CDM: Yea, I still get emails from them, and they really haven't changed, as people, at all.</em> <em>If you are making links, definitely link to punk-rock Ultra marathoner Catra Corbett. She has a great blog called <a href="http://www.blogger.com/.http://trailgirl.blogspot.com/">Dirt Diva</a>. (me: it's a killer running site)</em></div><br /><div></div><br /><div><em></em><em>me:</em> My Uncle Mike has run upwards of 68 marathons. He has concerns about larger runners running barefoot. I want him to be wrong, will you tell him he's wrong?</div><br /><div></div><br /><div>CDM: He's wrong.Weight makes no difference, it's actually more important for larger runners to run barefoot, it keeps the foot from heel-striking and encourages more of a midsole strike. Look at me! </div><br /><div></div><br /><div><em>me:</em> You're tiny </div><br /><div></div><br /><div><em>CDM:</em> No, I'm not. Tell your Uncle he's dead wrong. Then tell him <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~skeleton/danlhome.html">Dr. Daniel Lieberman</a> said so. <em>me: (</em>in my head) I love you Uncle Mike, but the frog-feet are staying. </div><br /><div></div><br /><div>me: One last essential question, what is your favorite cheese? </div><br /><div></div><br /><div><em>CDM: Cheez-whiz, and a Philly cheesesteak from <a href="http://www.genosteaks.com/">Geno's. </a></em></div><br /><div><em></em></div><br /><div><em></em><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 381px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 243px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5595892165494804514" border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pLsVUBuEahM/TaiaRrW1kCI/AAAAAAAAAOw/gJLV--1uwJA/s400/11111111111111.bmp" /> And with that, I forced the poor man to sign just about all of our copies.
