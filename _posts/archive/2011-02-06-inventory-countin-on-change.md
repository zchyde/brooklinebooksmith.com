<p><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 193px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 209px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5570641081719697218" border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TU7kjJ8Zr0I/AAAAAAAAAM4/_seatEuRCRg/s400/a-counting-sheep2.gif" />I arrived to work around 7 am this morning for our annual inventory. Dana and Evelyn had been there for an hour or so I think. We hire a company to count everything in the store...because it makes sense for the professionals to count....(we are very good with the alphabet but we don't want to push our luck.) For a few hours before we are open a crowd of inventory specialists come in with their oversized belt calculators with matching finger scanners and begin the chorus of <em>beep-beep scan Brrrrrrrrblip "price check!!!!"</em></p><p>The sound is so different than what I'm used to hearing, (either ambient post-alternative crooners, or 80's power jams.) I find it energizing. I also like the idea of a bunch of strangers pawing over all of the books. I wonder how many of them are triggered into checking out some new books when they leave...how could they not after putting their hands on literally thousands of them in a few early morning hours, when the brain is most nubile.**</p><p><em><span style="font-size:85%;">**I made that up</span></em></p><p>Inventory is also a time to take, well...stock of things. Hardy-har. You will notice some wild changes to the organization of the store in the coming weeks. I'm especially excited about our newly arranged Used book cellar/ events basement. I saw it this morning and thought, <em>wow, this is how it should have been all along! </em>We hope you agree, and really think you will...</p><p>The point I'm gettin' at is....change doesn't have to happen during pre-ordained calender bally-hoos. Sometimes a fresh start happens on a Sunday in February, or a Wednesday in October. Any morning, (or mid afternoon for that matter) we can take account of our lives, purge a moral, physical and spiritual inventory, and reinvent ourselves. </p><p>So keep an eye on us this month...cause this here butterfly is pumping some new blood into our 50 year old wings...</p><p><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 178px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 176px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5570641207270329090" border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TU7kqdqASwI/AAAAAAAAANA/uAUMmaEeyl4/s400/Counting%252520cookies.jpg" /></p>
