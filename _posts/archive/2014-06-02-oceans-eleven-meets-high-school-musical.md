It's well-plotted. It's funny. And it has fallen into the hands of the #WeNeedDiverseBooks movement, which has set out to prove that a book with a diverse cast on the cover can sell and that it is in the industry's interest to publish more such books.<br /><br />We're competing with lots of other independent bookstores in <a href="https://blog.varianjohnson.com/2014/04/the-great-greene-heist-challenge.html">The Great Greene Challenge</a>. Do I especially care if we end up being the store that sells the most copies in the first month? Nah. Do I think it's awesome that we're all motivating each other to help make the book a bestseller? Heck yes.<br /><br />Know a reader somewhere around middle school age? Have we got a book for you!<br /><br /><br />
