So if you're headed down into the basement straight for the coolest section (science fiction, duh) you might notice that it's not where it used to be. It didn't go to space or nothin', we just moved it down the aisle and it now faces mystery. It looks pretty cool. Also, we just had our big lighting overhaul completed in the UBC. The whole store has had its lighting re-rigged to be brighter, more efficient and eco-friendly. The UBC got some majorly bright lights that helped out the browsing in our subterranean cavern, and now there's an extra row of lighting down&nbsp;fiction to&nbsp;help you see all the books you may have missed before. Come check it out!<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vDybxRbPE7M/T_2-cYyAIWI/AAAAAAAAAjQ/Q_BYUhJIE1E/s1600/GoldenPlates1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vDybxRbPE7M/T_2-cYyAIWI/AAAAAAAAAjQ/Q_BYUhJIE1E/s200/GoldenPlates1.jpg" width="135" /></a>Additional "new formatting" came through the UBC last week in the shape of a graphic novel adaptation of the <i>Book of Mormon</i>. I hadn't seen anything quite like it before so it seemed noteworthy. It reads like a pretty exciting historical adventure comic, but you get the whole story of the Mormon scriptures. So if the South Park episode didn't go through enough detail for you, maybe these are a starting point. Or if you're already LDS, these might make a cool "I'm-a-Law-of-Consecrationist" gift to the 8-year-old in your life.<br /><br />In other UBC news, it's been pretty busy lately. People are movin', people are cleanin', people have time off and the weather is nice so they're totin' in books by the bag-, box-, and dresser drawer-ful. So we're being pretty selective and recommend that you call ahead or e-mail what sort of books you have to save some effort. And remember, our<b> buying hours are Wednesday through Saturday, 10 AM - 4 PM.</b> We can't take books outside those times. It's against Book Ordinance #279.<br /><br />kthxbai!
