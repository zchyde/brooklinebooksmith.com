Remember waking up early just to watch cartoons on Saturday mornings? Well, waking up to sell books is almost as sassifying. Almost.<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />We started carrying Taza chocolates and things have changed in my life since. I have lost 30 lbs, I can now complete a full leg split, and suddenly... I can speak Polish. The chocolates are that good. This particular brand is a local company in Somerville, and we are having a free tasting on Dec 18th. This chocolate tastes unlike any chocolate I have had, and now every other chocolate tastes of wax and plastics in comparison.<br /><br /><br /><br />On to my tip of the week!<br /><br /><br /><p><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 194px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 197px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5546828747976788546" border="0" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TPpLW6EUykI/AAAAAAAAALY/u8VrAmX45x4/s400/chocolo.jpg" /></p><br /><br /><p></p><br /><br /><p>In efforts to maintain a healthy BMI do NOT have more than one serving of fiber one's 90 calorie chocolate peanut butter bars. If you don't believe me, then try having 2 before bed. Let me know how you're feeling in the morning. My email is <a href="mailto:kate@brooklinebooksmith.com">kate@brooklinebooksmith.com</a>  The experience was reminiscent of my 2002 foray into the world of olestra. I'll leave it at that. Classy.</p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TPpMrtXWrKI/AAAAAAAAALg/cbKRcb3T-Ms/s1600/FiberOne.jpg"><img style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; WIDTH: 143px; FLOAT: right; HEIGHT: 143px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5546830204855823522" border="0" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TPpMrtXWrKI/AAAAAAAAALg/cbKRcb3T-Ms/s400/FiberOne.jpg" /></a><br /><p>What I'm saying is, instead of having a <em>substitute</em> for the real thing, have the damn thing. Forget O'doul's, and waxy chocolates and have the dogfish head and Taza. You'll need less and be a happier person all around.</p><p>If you read this far, thank you...and yes I am seeing a professional.<br /></p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TPpMrtXWrKI/AAAAAAAAALg/cbKRcb3T-Ms/s1600/FiberOne.jpg"></a><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TPpMrtXWrKI/AAAAAAAAALg/cbKRcb3T-Ms/s1600/FiberOne.jpg"></a><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L2x1PCw1zuI/TPpMrtXWrKI/AAAAAAAAALg/cbKRcb3T-Ms/s1600/FiberOne.jpg"></a>
