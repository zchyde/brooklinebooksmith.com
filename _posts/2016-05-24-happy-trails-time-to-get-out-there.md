Every year, the [American Hiking Society](https://www.americanhiking.org/about-us/) organizes and coordinates [National Trails Day](https://nationaltrailsday.americanhiking.org/) (NTD), a celebration of America’s outstanding Trail System. This year, the celebration falls on June 4th.  Local communities can host events, such as a run for the woods, hiking experiences, stewardship projects, bird watching expeditions, trail biking journeys, geocaching, and much more.  What kinds of adventures are you planning for NTD?  Click [here](https://nationaltrailsday.americanhiking.org/events/#page-1) to find events close to you.

Find your favorite park, [use this guide book](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781426216510), grab some birthday cake, and enjoy your adventure! The [Find Your Park](https://findyourpark.com/) project is a joint effort between the National Park Service and the National Park Foundation. Park visitors are encouraged to visit the National Parks both in person as well as online. Fun fact: the first National Park was Yellowstone, created in 1872.
