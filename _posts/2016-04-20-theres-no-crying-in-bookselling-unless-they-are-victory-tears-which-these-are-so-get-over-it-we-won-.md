&nbsp;Our race is not yet run…oh of course it is. I'm sure you heard all about it, but maybe not? Collectively, Booksmith booksellers competed in the Boston Marathon on Monday. Stretching two deep from curb to curb, all the way from Hopkinton to Copley Square, with our arms locked in readerly solidarity and chanting "WE WILL WE WILL ROCK YOU" so loud that we never heard (honestly!) the complaints of outraged race officials, we ended up coming in first place! Woohoo! Booksmith rocks! No medals were awarded, sadly.
<br>
<br>For real, though, we have a winning streak at the moment. We were humbled and thrilled to find that we are the recipients of the Women's National Book Association's&nbsp;[Pannell Award](http://www.wnba-books.org/news/pannell-award-winners-2016), which recognizes "the work of booksellers who stimulate, promote and encourage children's and young people's interest in books."&nbsp;
<br>And (not to be outdone by her amazing staff) Booksmith's beloved co-owner and manager Dana Brigham will be honored at the&nbsp;[6th Annual Brookline Youth Awards](http://www.brooklinehub.com/category/brooklinehub-youth-awards/)&nbsp;with the&nbsp;[Ethel Weiss Service Award](http://www.brooklinehub.com/brookline-youth-awards-to-honor-rene-feuerman-and-dana-brigham/), presented every year to the Brookline businessperson who best exemplifies service, commitment and passion toward Brookline's young people. Unless I'm mistaken, medals *will*be awarded. &nbsp;

<br>Hey! For only the second time ever in the 10+ years we've been collecting the "find of the week" - those wonderful bits of mystery and memory hiding inside of the used books we buy - the "find" was found! A reader got in touch with me last week, it turns out she knew the happy couple in the wedding photo, and the snapshot has now been returned to its owners.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>That photo up above is my kids in the woods yesterday, on top of a very short mountain in Dedham, listening to my super dramatic plein air reading of Nathaniel Hawthorne's *A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys*, one of the most delightfully entertaining pieces of literature to emerge from the 1850s.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Here's&nbsp;[one more thing](https://www.instagram.com/legokarlove/)&nbsp;before we part for the week, offered in recognition of yesterday's release of the fifth book in Karl Ove Knausgaard's&nbsp;[My Struggle](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780914671398)&nbsp;cycle.&nbsp;

Thanks for reading,
