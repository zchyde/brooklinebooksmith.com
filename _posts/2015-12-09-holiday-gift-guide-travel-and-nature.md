![9780316378215](https://images.brooklinebooksmith.com/9780316378215.jpg)**Cabin Porn: Inspiration for Your Quiet Place Somewhere**&nbsp; by Zach Klein and Steven Leckart, photography by Noah Kalina ([**Buy**](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316378215))

It's exactly what it is. It's cabin porn. Every conceivable style, location, and reason for being is in these pages. There are converted silos, treehouses, modernist shapes extending as if by magic out over the stream, or what appears to be a pile of ancient farm equipment and peeling plywood in the most overgrown corner of the field. Let's face it, most of us who dream of our own little cabin in the woods will never build one. That's what this book is for.

The old descriptive phrase 'building blocks of life' brings to mind homogeneous cookie cutter entities, but that image could not be less indicative of what is happening inside those cell walls. Jack Challoner has assembled the best science, the clearest information graphics, and the most jaw-dropping hi-res images of the life in, on, and around cells of every sort. A highly engaging read for any cellular spelunkers, whether they be novice or advanced.

Leila Jeffreys' exquisitely detailed portraits capture the virility and individuality of dozens of species of bird. We rarely see them but from a distance or behind the bars of a cage, yet here they stand still for the camera, allowing us access to more of their inner nature than we ever expected to find. Look at that owl on the cover. Fierce, lighter than air, demanding. Wait until you see the parakeets: in Jeffreys' eye they are more intimidating than a hungry bear.

![9780812993172](https://images.brooklinebooksmith.com/9780812993172.jpg)**Thunder & Lightning: Weather Past, Present, Future** by Lauren Redniss ([**Buy**](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780812993172))

Lauren Redniss respects no precedent. In Radioactive, the world was introduced to Marie Curie in an expressive, enigmatic blend of art and biography. Thunder & Lightning blazes with an even hotter creative fire. Here is an exhilarating passage to the heart of the human experience of weather; its effects on our history, our stories, our body and soul. Drawing from first person accounts, news reports and her unfairly rich imagination, Lauren Redniss has, once again, redefined what a book can be.

![9781631910005](https://images.brooklinebooksmith.com/9781631910005.jpg)**Atlas of Cursed Places: A Travel Guide to Dangerous and Frightful Destinations** by Olivier Le Carrer ([**Buy**](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781631910005))

Zapadnaya Litsa, northwest Russia, where nearly half of Russia's retired nuclear submarines lie rusting, holding as much radioactive fuel as thirty Chernobyls. Aokigahara forest, at the foot of Mount Fuji, where local volunteers organize an annual search, hunting among the trees for the bodies of the estimated one hundred people who come there each year to commit suicide. Cumbre Vieja, the Canary Island volcano whose eruption would likely emit a ring of tsunamis that would make a Hollywood special effects team give up on even trying. Detailing all of these places and a few dozen more, The Atlas of Cursed Places is the most deliciously miserable book of the year.

![9780544668256](https://images.brooklinebooksmith.com/9780544668256.jpg)**Thing Explainer: Complicated Stuff in Simple Words** by Randall Munroe ([**Buy**](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780544668256))

**Signed copies available!** In 2006, Randall Munroe saw the writing on the wall. The political atmosphere was thick with science-denial, and telling someone that you were a NASA roboticist just didn't impress anymore. Like so many others, he decided that it was time to make the leap into web comics. Nine years into this new career, Munroe has released his second hard-science-for-the-layperson book, and it's simply amazing. You want to know exactly why we built the Large Hadron Collider? Read the incredibly detailed "Big Tiny Thing Hitter" page, where Munroe gracefully explains the most complex machine in history - by likening it to tossing a car overboard to see if the splash brings up any of the really big fish which you hypothesize may be pushing your boat through what could be an ocean of beer. Somehow Randall Munroe makes it all make sense.

![9781579656713](https://images.brooklinebooksmith.com/9781579656713.jpg)**The Dogist: Photographic Encounters with 1,000 Dogs** by Elias Weiss Friedman ([**Buy**](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781579656713))

You can tell as you turn the pages, this isn't just another catalog of endearing dogs. There is something passing between the photographer and his subjects. Elias Weiss Friedman goes right for the eyes; if you know anything at all about dogs, you know that the eyes are where its at. They are the prehistoric bridge between our species, and in this collection of portraits of a thousand dogs, Friedman catches the light of a thousand different souls. A joyful, thoughtful book that is guaranteed to strike a chord.
