I've been between books for about two weeks. I've quickly read a few graphic novels which I liked but not enough to convincingly recommend to a stranger. I've thumbed through a few mysteries; flipped through a short story collection all to no avail. I watched a bunch of stuff on Netflix and spent nearly a full day researching which leather recliner to buy. Oh and I had a blog post to finish. Under the influence of a flexible deadline I emptied my bookcases and culled a handful of books that I'd hoped would end this misery. I won't go into how these books were culled but let's just say that it may or may not have revolved around having my [cat](https://www.instagram.com/p/BCJ4AAwObWn/) sniff and then lay on each one. Let's get started, shall we?

[***The Glacier*** by Jeff Wood](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781937512415) (Two Dollar Radio)
{: .present-before-paste}

[***Square Wave*** by Mark De Silva](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781937512392) (Two Dollar Radio)
{: .present-before-paste}

I've been on board with [Two Dollar Radio](http://twodollarradio.com) from jump street. They got me hooked on [Rudolph Wurlitzer](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-ca-rudolph-wurlitzer15-2009nov15-story.html) bleak americana then introduced me to the likes of Scott McClanahan and Barbara Browning. Their roster is a veritable who's-who of emerging, exciting, and energetic authors. With Jeff Wood's *The Glacier* and Mark De Silva's *Square Wave*, Two Dollar Radio has once again pumped some fresh life into the turgid backwaters of independent literature.&nbsp;
{: .present-before-paste}

*The Glacier* is billed as "A spellbinding work in the spirit of [Tarkovsky](http://andrei-tarkovsky.com) or [Jodorowsky](http://jodorowskysdune.com) that re-imagines the American frontier at the turn of the millennium…" Tarkovky *and* Jodorowksy? I'll take a slice of that. I just flipped to a random page and there's a character with the name Mud Man. Is Mud Man a central figure? A man at all? Mud, even? I almost assuredly will end up reading this book.
{: .present-before-paste}

Likewise Mark De Silva's debut novel *Square Wave* looks equally captivating (though no mention of any mud men or women). In parts political espionage and dystopian environmentalism, *Square Wave* seems like one of those books that in a couple years everyone in the know will make me feel like a bit of a rube for not having read. I probably will end up reading this book but I fear at some point I'll be made to feel like a rube regardless. Most stunningly, my cat neither sniffed nor sat on nor remotely seemed interested in this book. Maybe *Square Wave*&nbsp;contains ideas so big they'd crush my cat's brain - or even worse, mine - into a diamond. What couple of rubes.

[***Clinch*** by Martin Holm&eacute;n](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781782271925) (Pushkin Press)
{: .present-before-paste}

While slated for a June release, (I managed to score an advance reading copy (The second best perk of working in a bookstore - the first being unlimited access to a candy jar))&nbsp;*Clinch* is set in a 1930's Stockholm teeming with salty, nefarious figures slogging through nightclubs and opulent hotels. Like any good Nordic mystery novel there's a murder and then someone inevitably tries to solve it with little to no razzle-dazzle. I don't know. The back cover does mention 'gritty violence' three times (!!!) and compares Holm&eacute;n to Raymond Chandler which is a guaranteed one way trip right up my alley. Will I end up reading this? Yeah… maybe. But let's not commit to anything just yet. This is all moving so fast for me.

[***Carpet Sweeper Tales&nbsp;***by Julie Doucet](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781770462397) (Drawn & Quarterly)
{: .present-before-paste}

Julie Doucet is so much more than a cartoonist. The emotion she squeezes out of a little bit of ink and paper transcends race and gender. Everyone should read her brilliant *[My New York Diary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-vs5hZu744)&nbsp;*and relive what's it felt like to be young and broke and having to rely on a bit of ingenuity to make it on your own. *Carpet Sweeper Tales* is a collection of short stories presented in a photo-comic style with images lifted from old European magazines. Will I read this? You bet your sweet ditty I will. In fact I already read it. Twice. It made me want to go back in time and make some poor clerk at Tower Records on Newbury Street go in the back and fish out her comics from wherever they kept the incoming comics and zines. It's alright. I got all day. Well technically I don't. My parents think at I'm at school. But trust me, I'll wait.

[***Patience*** by Dan Clowes](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781606999059)
{: .present-before-paste}

I'm drooling. If you think I'm not going to devour this like a lion that's been jonesin' all summer for some sweet delectable gazelle meat you neither know anything about me nor of the insatiable appetites of ravenous lions. I know its clich&eacute; to refer to Dan Clowes as a deity but the guy is *pretty good*. A number of years ago I met him at a book signing and I got to shake his hand and the look in his quizzical eye as he peered into my soul hinted at one question: *"Why is this guy's hand so damn sweaty?"&nbsp;*Yeah of course I'm going to read this. Don't be silly.
