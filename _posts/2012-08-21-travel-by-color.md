I have a vivid memory of the scene in the BBC's production of C.S. Lewis's&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780064471077" href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780064471077"><em>Voyage of the Dawn Treader</em></a>&nbsp;where two school children are sucked up from their humdrum school day into a framed piece of artwork to land in the middle of a strange world where the creatures are fantastical and the colors are new. Up until last month, I considered this phenomenon to only exist in the world of myth. That was before I traveled into one of Cezanne’s paintings.</div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 19px;">My husband and I were visiting his cousin in the south of France, when our hosts decided to give us a tour of Aix en Provence, where they had previously lived for 20 ye<a data-mce-href="http://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_7514.jpg" href="http://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_7514.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7964" data-mce-src="http://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_7514-300x225.jpg" height="225" src="http://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_7514-300x225.jpg" style="border: 0px; cursor: default; float: right;" title="IMG_7514" width="300" /></a>ars. We eagerly followed them through the narrow streets lined with walls the color of creamed corn with pigeon-blue shuttered windows. We watched the cobblestones for the markers that showed our path to be Cezanne’s. Eventually we ended up at an exhibition where we viewed some of Cezanne’s early works, the painter’s palette, along with a book of Emile Zola’s, inscribed to his childhood friend, Cezanne. All of&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/untitled.png" href="http://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/untitled.png"><img alt="" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8015" data-mce-src="http://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/untitled.png" height="201" src="http://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/untitled.png" style="border: 0px; cursor: default; float: left;" title="untitled" width="251" /></a>these artifacts were thrilling, but the real treasure had greeted us along the horizon as we approached the town by highway, a presence I felt looming beyond the city streets: Mount St. Victoire, the subject of several of Cezanne’s most stunning landscapes.</div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 19px;">On our way out of Aix en Provence, we drove&nbsp;<em>la Route Cezanne</em>, the route which Cezanne used to stroll, pausing to capture the fields, trees, and occasional houses on canvas. As we careened around the narrow roads, closer and closer to the base of Mt. St. Victoire, I rolled down the window and stared. Golden fields stretched before me, bordered by dark green Cypress trees. Occasionally a small cream stucco house would appear with a red-orange tiled roof. I recognized it all with something of the thrill of reunion and the sudden realization: We were inside one of Cezanne’s paintings. The colors were unmistakable: we had arrived, entered a world where life and art blurred into brilliant shades of color and sudden dashes of light...</div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 19px;">Find the rest of this post and&nbsp;discover books about traveling by color <a href="http://globecornerbookstore.com/blogs/">on our blog at globecorner.com.</a></div>
