Looking for some new great board books? Whether they are a gift or for you, these are sure to be parent pleasers!

[Little Pea by Amy Krouse Rosenthal illustrated by Jen Corace](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781452142890)

also by Rosenthal and Corace:

[Little Hoot](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781452152073)


I love how Rosenthal takes classic parenting problems and flips them around. Instead of craving candy, Little Pea wants veggies! Instead of begging to stay wake Little Hoot only wants to sleep! Clever little jokes, and the adorable illustrations make these cute, funny, light-hearted board books a must!

[The Gossie and Friends series by Olivier Dunrea](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/author/%22Dunrea%2C%20Olivier%22)


No series of board books gives me more joy than this one! Simple, quick, but full of character, you will quickly become attached to this group of adorable ducklings! There's [Gossie and Gertie](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780618747931), [BooBoo](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780618755059), [Peedie](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780618755066), [Gus](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780547867618), [Jasper and Joop](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780544173200), [Gemma](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780547868516), [Ollie](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780618755035), and [Gideon](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780547983998). I couldn't possibly pick a favorite, and you can often find me reading them to myself (or coworkers) on slower days.

[Shh! We Have A Plan](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763679774) and [Oh No, George! by Chris Haughton](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780763676520)



Haughton has a great sense of humor and his color palates are beautiful! His board books are full of emotion and humor, and give you the room to add your own bits and pieces to the story.

These are just a few of **my** favorites. Stop by the store and ask us for us more recommendations!
