In March we celebrate [World Water Day](http://www.unwater.org/worldwaterday) (March 22), a time to be thankful for our waterways (streams, ponds, lakes, rivers, bogs, estuaries, wetlands, and our oceans). It's also a time to remember how lucky many of us are to have clean, fresh drinking water, water for recreation, and picturesque water-centered landscapes to view. One might also say, everywhere we are, we're in a watershed. World Water Day finds its roots in the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. At that time, the U.N. recommended an international observance for water. The first celebration was in 1993, and each year there is a new theme. The 2016 theme is water and jobs. This water-inspired, eco-initiative reminds us to learn more about water issues, and to take eco-actions to protect this valuable natural resource. To properly celebrate World Water Day, let's explore some good books about water.
