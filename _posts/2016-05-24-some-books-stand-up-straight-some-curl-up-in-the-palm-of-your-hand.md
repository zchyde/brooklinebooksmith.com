She'd been searching for that book for so many days that when I found it on the shelf she almost leaned in to hug me. She pulled back, almost lost her balance, we laughed, and then she bought that hardcover.
<br>
<br>That last bit doesn't always happen, though. The customer, so thrilled to have found the book they just heard about on the radio, or that a friend has been raving about, will simply choose to wait for the paperback.

But look over there. Every one of those books in that picture skipped right past hardcover and came to life as a paperback, literally doubling the likelihood that someone will buy them and read them. We're in no way advocating a boycott of the beautiful hardcover (which, along with bicycles and ice cream is one of the greatest objects ever invented). And just yesterday we launched our&nbsp;[Signed First Edition Book Club](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/sfe/)&nbsp;- a selection of titles hand-picked by Booksmith booksellers and buyers - signed, sealed and delivered right to your door (or for pick-up in store)? But at the same time, through our buying as well as our&nbsp;[Small Press Book Club](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif1by4zPXMAhVM1oMKHa--D5QQFggcMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fsmallpressbkcb&amp;usg=AFQjCNHYDgwk4wfYuUABwzvzwQwr9zYptw&amp;sig2=rXM0XnvOeGJmiKSiSL2hRw&amp;bvm=bv.122852650,bs.2,d.cWw), we are committed to promoting the amazing small presses that choose to bind primarily in paperback. They are opening doors for new writers who might not otherwise be heard, and they are quite simply increasing the odds that someone will read a book.&nbsp;[Click](http://www.openletterbooks.org/)&nbsp;[on](http://restless-press.com/)&nbsp;[these](http://twodollarradio.com/)&nbsp;[links](http://www.unnamedpress.com/)&nbsp;[to](http://www.otherpress.com/)&nbsp;[find](http://www.europaeditions.com/)&nbsp;[out](https://www.graywolfpress.org/)&nbsp;[who](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/)&nbsp;[we're](http://www.feministpress.org/)&nbsp;[talking](http://www.mhpbooks.com/)&nbsp;[about](http://www.sarabandebooks.org/). And support the recent attempts by a much more established publisher, Farrar, Straus Giroux.&nbsp;[FSG Paperback Originals](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ_NWrxPXMAhUq0YMKHab_B7wQFggcMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fsgoriginals.com%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNHSGPgjg0CGrhEXUDTAI3eun6jYjQ&amp;sig2=oZvHLZIydeMjxvhxilJRkA&amp;bvm=bv.122852650,bs.2,d.cWw)&nbsp;brought us&nbsp;[Jeff VanderMeer](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780374104092)'s&nbsp;*Area X*&nbsp;trilogy, an easy pick for the best and most groundbreaking fiction of 2014. These publishers see wisdom in choosing to provide great literature at an affordable price, let's tell them they're doing the right thing.

Here's another small good thing getting noticed:&nbsp;[Papercuts JP](http://www.papercutsjp.com/), with its staff of three, got their story told in&nbsp;[*The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/23/interview-with-a-bookstore-papercuts-jp-the-smallest-bookstore-in-boston)!
<br>
<br>Last week I mentioned the Black Seed Writers and&nbsp;[The Pilgrim](http://www.thepilgrim.org/), and then the next day they got this&nbsp;[moving write-up](https://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2016/05/19/inside-literary-magazine-helping-homeless-writers-heard/58FQxrMl1N4143rP5kSkBI/story.html)&nbsp;in the Globe. Definitely worth a read. The third book from No Fixed Address Press, the group's in-house imprint, will *be Dressing Wounds on Tremont Street*, by poet Margaret Miranda. The release party at St. Paul's cathedral on June 1st at 7pm is open to the public, maybe we'll see you there. Oh, and the group's founder and Booksmith regular, James Parker, shines in this [short essay on empathy](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/books/review/who-gets-to-tell-other-peoples-stories.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fbookends&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=review&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection&amp;_r=0)&nbsp;in the most recent&nbsp;*NYT Book Review*.
<br>
<br>Have you seen any of&nbsp;[these](http://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/2016/05/18/where-are-boston-invisible-poems/D5hS6hfxvZHcBtqa4gcT4I/story.html)&nbsp;around town?
