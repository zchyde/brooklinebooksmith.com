The first book I read by Hilary McKay was a used copy of [The Exiles](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781416967286) picked up for 90p at a charity shop in England, sometime in (I think) the mid-nineties. (I was smaller, then. All the years in the nineties bear a fairly strong resemblance to all the other years in the nineties.)

*The Exiles* is the first book in a classic family adventure trilogy, featuring a pack of wild-haired, dreadfully fearless sisters with the will of bulldozers, who race grubs, read books by the bushel, and get muddy and sunburned at every opportunity. They're the kind of funny that hurts you in the middle, and the kind of family that (if you're an only kid like I was) make you equal parts jealous and grateful not to have siblings.

The second McKay series I read begins with [Saffy's Angel](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780689849343). These books feature the Cassons, a family with artist parents and children named for paint colors–except for Saffron, who is an adopted cousin and can't find her name on the color wheel. When she's left a mysterious legacy by the children's grandfather, it might be the thing she needs to feel fully Casson again. The whole story is, once again, both tender and ruthlessly funny.

(Side note: at some point it was decided that this book should be given the worst cover redesign in history. If you need to, wrap the book in a paper bag and read it that way. Do not let the cover stop you.)

Both series are solidly middle grade; they're great to read on your own, but also make excellent family read-alouds (although some of the funnier bits can be a bit challenging). If any of your families have read and loved Jeanne Birdsall's [Penderwicks](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780440420477) books, I strongly, strongly, strongly (how many times can I repeat this word before someone edits it down? STRONGLY!) recommend you meet the Exiles and the Cassons. They're exactly the kind of book the Penderwicks were born out of, and among the best of that sort.

Somehow I missed it when McKay started publishing an early chapter book series about a little black English girl named Lulu (illustrated by Priscilla Lamont), whose defining feature is her no-nonsense, steadfast, all-encompassing love for EVERY ANIMAL ON EARTH. Fans of Sara Pennypacker's [Clementine](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780786838837) series will enjoy the riotous misadventures of Lulu and her episodic crusades for the well-being of beasts, but Lulu has a confidence and wit of her very own.

I meandered optimistically into the first book, [Lulu and the Duck in the Park](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780807548097), in which (following a dog riot at a local park) Lulu rescues an imperiled duck egg only to have it hatch under her sweater in class.

GOOD NEWS: LULU IS PERFECT.

At this point I started picking up the next Lulu book every time I stopped by the library. Lulu (who starts with a sizable personal zoo in book one) goes on to meet a wet hedgehog, a bagged cat, a disreputable dog at the seaside, a neighborly rabbit and its apathetic young owner, and a rooftop hamster. Her adventures (currently at six volumes) rollick along with great humor, and Lulu's unshakably responsible attitude towards the creatures under her care is impressive, but never a drag. Fellow animal lovers will find a kindred spirit.

I recommend the entire series wholeheartedly, but I'm a particular fan of book two, [Lulu and the Dog from the Sea](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780807548219). For young readers who want to learn more about the animals they love, you might try the alluringly palm-sized and picture-packed paperback [DK Pocket Genius](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/site/pocket%2520genius) guides for [Dogs](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781465445858) and [Animals](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780756692841), or (in the Nature section) [Do Unto Animals](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781579656232), a loving guide to caring for animals domestic and wild by Tracey Stewart, abundantly illustrated by Lisel Ashlock.
