![](/uploads/versions/060816---x----326-656x---.jpg)Every once in a while a Booksmith morning is perfectly quiet. Just our most regular of early morning regulars, just a couple of kids poking around in the back, crumpled printouts of required summer reading in hand, searching for&nbsp;[*Because of Mr. Terrupt*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780375858246), and [*Brown Girl Dreaming*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780399252518), and maybe do we have a cheaper used copy of this Mark Twain book I have to read, because I only brought this much money?
<br>*crumpled up ball of bills is placed on the counter.*
<br>(Yup, we are starting to gather and sort all of those summer reading titles, so look for a comprehensive, school-by-school, grade-by-grade display to emerge over the next few weeks.)&nbsp;

It's easiest to appreciate these kinds of days when you get to be at the register up front, watching the passersby through the big picture windows. It's a widescreen, hi-def view of a crystal clear start to the day. And then politics flits across your mind, the arena where there can never just be "news" anymore. Everything that happens is the beginning of the end of the world, for somebody, it seems.
<br>Ah! Shake it off.
<br>Turn your gaze to the sky up there! It's so blue, and later today huge clouds will start to pile high up into the atmosphere, and before the inevitable evening [thunderstorm](https://www.slate.com/articles/video/video/2016/05/lightning_storm_in_super_slow_motion_video_from_florida_researchers.html?wpsrc=atlasobscura), and hopefully just after you get out of work you might take a minute to sit somewhere off to the side of your commute. Maybe you'll dip into one of a number of&nbsp;[great books](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781101947135)&nbsp;we have&nbsp;[fallen](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781619025271)&nbsp;in&nbsp;[love](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781590179659)&nbsp;with lately. Maybe it could be one of those books over there,&nbsp;[*Lila*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781250074843)&nbsp;or&nbsp;[*Square Wave*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781937512392), and maybe you'll come back and join your neighbors in&nbsp;[one](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-06/book-club/)&nbsp;of our&nbsp;[two](https://twitter.com/smallpressbkcb)&nbsp;book clubs; a pair of spaces where it's truly safe to share your opinions and reactions. And then you can cast your vote for the next book club pick, and we'll just count the hands and move on with our lives, like it ought to be.
<br>Peace and happy reading, everyone.
<br>
<br>Now, before we move on in this newsletter, check out Lydia's blog post about the&nbsp;[second great novel you and I will never get to read](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/this-week-in-books/2016/06/06/this-week-in-books-by-the-time-david-mitchell-s-next-book-comes-out-we-ll-all-be-dead/). And take a look at&nbsp;[Banksy's latest action](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2016/06/banksy-bristol-primary-school/), it might just be my favorite. Be sure to read the letter he wrote!

One last thing: the&nbsp;[Brookline Farmer's Market](https://brooklinefarmersmarket.com/)&nbsp;is up and running again! One more reason to come shop at Booksmith on a Thursday afternoon.

Thanks for reading,
