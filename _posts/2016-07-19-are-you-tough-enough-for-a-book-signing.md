As you can tell from how many of his loyal fans he strangled, Chuck Palahniuk was&nbsp;*psyched*&nbsp;for his Sunday afternoon marathon book signing. Eight-and-a-half hours! Easily one for the record books. And Booksmith was equally psyched to welcome Chuck back to the store for another round of his most unusual book signing stylings. Now let us take a moment to thank Brookline's finest for (among countless other things) not clearing the sidewalk of those adoring fans who apparently started lining up at 2am on Sunday morning outside our door.

I came across an&nbsp;[amazing short film](https://vimeo.com/137464081)&nbsp;the other day. It made me contemplate the loneliness of creation, the network of hidden helping hands that are so easy for each of us to ignore, and the endless repetitions that must come before you master a craft. And then I thought, wait a second, here's this book&nbsp;[Pond](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780399575891)&nbsp;which is blowing my mind right now, and it's&nbsp;[Claire-Louise Bennett](https://www.vogue.com/13455285/pond-claire-louise-bennett-interview/)'s first novel. I think she must be cheating. Not cool, Bennett.

<br>This week we look forward to visits from&nbsp;[Daniel Silva](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-07/daniel-silva-the-black-widow/),&nbsp;[Cheryl Lu-Lien](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-07/cheryl-lu-lien-tan-sarong-party-girls/) [Tan](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-07/cheryl-lu-lien-tan-sarong-party-girls/),&nbsp;[Delia Ephron](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-07/delia-ephron-siracusa/)&nbsp;and more, and we've still got some tickets left for an evening of good food and great music courtesy of the&nbsp;[The Follen Angels](https://follenangels.com/), at the Holiday Inn, Brookline on Friday, July 22nd at 7pm.
<br>
<br>Next time you're down aisle four, you'll find among our literary journals, you'll find&nbsp;[Ecotone](https://ecotonemagazine.org/ecotone-authors/shuchi-saraswat/). Shuchi Saraswat, Booksmith buyer and bookseller, has a featured essay in there, do yourself a favor and take a copy home with you.
