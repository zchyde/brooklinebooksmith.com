And everyone is giving suggestions left and right. But, my friends, this is the one you want! I loved this when it came out in hardcover last year and now that it's in paperback there is no excuse for you not to pick it up for your favorite middle-grade reader (or, quite frankly, yourself).<br /><br /><em>The Secret Country</em> begins when our hero Ben encounters a talking cat in a pet shop. Soon he is finding magical creatures everywhere â€“ unicorns, wood-sprites, and dragons, all kidnapped from the magical world of Eidolon. Will he be able to help them return home?<br /><br /><strong>Parents beware</strong>: This is the kind of story that will have your kids staying up late, reading with a flashlight under the covers.</div>
