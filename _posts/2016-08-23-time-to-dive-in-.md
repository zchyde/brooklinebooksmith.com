![](/uploads/versions/backtoschool1---x----510-236x---.jpg)You can choose to look at this like you're diving into a pool in Rio and you might die, or you can look at this like you're diving into a pool in Rio and you might win gold. Either way, summer vacation is over and it's time to jump back in, kiddo.

<br>Booksmith knows that every parent looks for ways to make the entry into a new school year as painless as possible for themselves, and that's why we've started carrying a variety of bottle openers and flasks.
<br>Wait, let me start over.
<br>Booksmith knows that every parent looks for ways to make the entry into a new school year as painless as possible for *their child*, and that's why we always stock up on the most fun and thoughtful back-to-school books and gear. Right inside the front door you'll find an all-ages-appropriate variety of writing tools, electronic accessories, lunch storage, spitball ammunition, and plenty of handpicked books to offer [encouragement](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780385384711) for [little ones](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781442422483) facing [scary first days](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780553509441).
<br>We'll turn end of summer *ennui*\* into an autumnal surge of *esprit de corps*\*\*!
<br>And if none of our ideas does the trick, [get your kid one of these](http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2016/08/slow-dance-picture-frame-illusion/). It won't help with school and all that, but everyone will feel better just having it around.

<br>*\*from Webster's: "Ennui: the feeling of making mac-n-cheese out of the box for the second time on a hot summer day"
<br>\*\*from Webster's: "Esprit de corps: a momentary cessation of ennui"*
