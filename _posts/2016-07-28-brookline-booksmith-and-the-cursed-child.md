Two days from now, where will you be?

You will probably all be here, at the Booksmith, celebrating J.K. Rowling's triumphant dramatic return to the world of Harry Potter. [Harry Potter and the Cursed Child](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781338099133?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=harrypotter-2016) is a two-part play currently in previews at the [Palace Theatre, London](https://www.harrypottertheplay.com/), a nineteen-years-later continuation of the seven original books. Heinously, we can't all go to London; for us, however, there's the book! The printed version of the script is coming out on the stroke of midnight, Sunday, July 31.

We will be kicking off the book with a good old-fashioned midnight release party, with festivities starting at 9P.M. on Saturday. You should absolutely join us! Read on for more information about what we're doing (and what you can therefore also do).

**BASICS**

* You can&nbsp;**[preorder](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781338099133?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=harrypotter-2016)&nbsp;**the book or **purchase at our release party** for 20% off the cover price. This discount only applies to preorders (picked up at any time) and books purchased in the store between **12 midnight and closing** on Saturday night.
* Starting at **8:30A.M. on Saturday**, go to the front register to receive a numbered wristband that reserves your spot in line to purchase the book.
* At **9P.M. on Saturday**, the party begins! See the table at the front door to get sorted into your correct house (remember, it's what you feel that matters most). The party is free and open to all!


**HOUSE POINTS!**

What is the point of being sorted if you can't compete against the other, much less awesome houses? House points are won by participating in trivia, arriving in costume, finishing crosswords and word searches, and finding the items in our scavenger hunt.

You can also get points by sharing on **social media**. Get 2 for each post on social media using **#BBPotterParty** and 3 for each post you make from our photobooth using **#BBPotterParty**.

(P.S. You can find us on Twitter at [@booksmithtweets](https://twitter.com/booksmithtweets?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) and [@kidsmithbooks](https://twitter.com/kidsmithbooks), on Instagram [@brooklinebooksmith](https://www.instagram.com/brooklinebooksmith/), and on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/brooklinebooksmith)!)

You'll report to the Info desk facing the front door any time you have points to claim.
