*Don't Be A Jerk* is a funny and candid approach to the deepest and most influential zen teaching – just don't be a jerk. &nbsp; Warner's title is a witty paraphrasing of Zen master Eihei Dōgen's (1200-1253) *Treasury of the True Dharma Eye*.&nbsp; In accessible language, Warner explains the details of the ancient text.&nbsp; He expands on some of Dogen's more complex ideas about feminism and the depth of the Heart Sutra, to Dogen's approach to the more daily intricacies of life, like the process of cleaning and maintaining traditional robes.&nbsp; All of this without the traditional maps, genealogical charts, glossary, and bibliography to wade through.

*Pond&nbsp;*is a collection of musings – the conscious thoughts of an unnamed character. Bennett shines her literary light on seemingly ordinary things and the result is a pleasant meditation on solitude.&nbsp; Each minute observation is an honest depiction of life in a secluded coastal Irish town.
