I mean, it's a new book, but it's put together like a classic--our main character has lost his father, and he and his mother are close to losing their diner. In a small Rhode Island town, the solution for being trapped in grief and strapped for cash may be one and the same: the biggest opportunity to pull quahogs that anyone's seen for decades. It's satisfyingly filled to the brim, like a quahogger's bullrake, with perseverance, personal strength, and tantalizing details of the fisherman's trade--with a side of mobsters and pirates.<br /><br />There's really nothing quite like a book on the water--here are some more that might catch you in their wake.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b>My Heart Is On the Water</b></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Kids' Books for the Roving Reader</b></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><i><b>Swallows and Amazons</b></i><b> by Arthur Ransome</b> -- 1939 classic in every sense, about kids who actually get to sail off from their parents and have adventures on islands.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><b> </b></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b><i>The Turtle of Oman</i></b><i> </i><b>by Naomi Shihab Nye</b> -- Aref is devastated to leave his home in Oman for <i>Michigan</i>, but like a sea turtle, he will find his way home no matter where he travels.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><b><br /></b></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b><i>Island of the Blue Dolphins</i> by Scott O'Dell<i> </i></b><i>-- </i>Stranded on her island when the rest of her tribe leaves for better grounds, Karana survives the elements of the Pacific alone.
