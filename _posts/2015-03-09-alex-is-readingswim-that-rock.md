_Swim That Rock_ is a classic. I mean, it's a new book, but it's put together like a classic--our main character has lost his father, and he and his mother are close to losing their diner. In a small Rhode Island town, the solution for being trapped in grief and strapped for cash may be one and the same: the biggest opportunity to pull quahogs that anyone's seen for decades. It's satisfyingly filled to the brim, like a quahogger's bullrake, with perseverance, personal strength, and tantalizing details of the fisherman's trade--with a side of mobsters and pirates.  

There's really nothing quite like a book on the water--here are some more that might catch you in their wake.  

**My Heart Is On the Water**

**Kids' Books for the Roving Reader**

_**Swallows and Amazons**_ **by Arthur Ransome** -- 1939 classic in every sense, about kids who actually get to sail off from their parents and have adventures on islands.

**_The Turtle of Oman_****by Naomi Shihab Nye** -- Aref is devastated to leave his home in Oman for _Michigan_, but like a sea turtle, he will find his way home no matter where he travels.

**_Island of the Blue Dolphins_ by Scott O'Dell**_--_ Stranded on her island when the rest of her tribe leaves for better grounds, Karana survives the elements of the Pacific alone. We have this in the UBC.

_**The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle**_ **by Avi** -- It's 1832, and Charlotte Doyle is returning to Rhode Island from England. Her voyage goes awry, and she is trapped aboard a mutinying ship with a cruel captain at the helm. Worse yet, she's soon on trial for murder.

**_Over Sea, Under Stone_ by Susan Cooper** -- A holiday on the coast of Cornwall takes a menacing and mythological turn--as they may be one step ahead of some much more frightening people in finding the Holy Grail.

**_Treasure Island_ by Robert Louis Stevenson** -- You know the story, but trust me, it is well worth the time to go back to the original swashbuckler.

**_Heart of a Samurai_ by Margi Preus** --In 1841, Manjiro is trapped on a deserted island and unable to return home through Japan's closed borders. So instead, he travels the world, breaking all expectations as he goes.

**YA Books:**

**_The Scorpio Races_****by Maggie Steifvater** -- Man-eating horses rise from the waters, trapped and raced once a year by the ambitious and the fearful. Sean is a champion racer. Puck never meant to race at all. But now that she is racing--the first girl ever--she can't hesitate for a moment.

**_Midwinterblood_** **by Marcus Sedgwick** -- This journey will take you through time and through lifetimes, over water and across the strange, treacherous territory of Blessed Island, whose blessing is bloody, and whose story never moves in a straight line.

**_Tides_ by Betsy Cornwell** -- Selkies, and the girl who finds them. Different, eerie, and romantic. You can order this book through us.

I also, on the YA side, highly recommend **_Monstrous Affections_, edited by Kelly Link and Gavin Grant_,Â _ **which includes some snippets of the high, and extremely monstrous, seas.

For the ambitious, also please see _**Master and Commander**_**by Patrick O'Brian**and the twenty-some books that follow it. Seaborne adventuring through storm, battle, and more, with exquisite detail and wonderful characters. You can usually find some in the UBC, or order them from our website.

Happy reading!
