[![](/uploads/versions/brickinwall_1---x----1200-627x---.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1H9bli79to)You'll want to find out what's behind that brick.

For no particular reason, this week we brought in a pile of Sinclair Lewis'&nbsp;[It Can't Happen Here](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780451465641). Look for it when you're browsing the front tables, and then let us know if&nbsp;[this rings true.](https://www.salon.com/2015/09/29/it_really_can_happen_here_the_novel_that_foreshadowed_donald_trumps_authoritarian_appeal/)&nbsp;However you vote, just make sure your head is well out of the sand.&nbsp;[Like this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kotWv4MCxNI), his head's not in the sand!

Everybody knows that this is the first of 364 consecutive International Men's Days, but I hope to extend International Women's Day for at least a few more hours. Let's take a moment to catch up with this&nbsp;[essential reading list](https://lithub.com/33-life-changing-books-in-honor-of-international-womens-day/), and then find a few heroes maybe you've never heard of in this list of ten underappreciated&nbsp;[female revolutionaries](https://www.filmsforaction.org/articles/10-female-revolutionaries-that-you-probably-didnt-learn-about-in-history-class/).

Hey, if you've read this far, maybe you'd like to help us out? I'm looking to expand our audience beyond the bounds of Brookline. As you may have figured out, this has hardly ever been a typical retail "newsletter." For one thing, I've only used four exclamation points in the entire thing (to see all four of them, you'll have to subscribe) and one of them is used in the find-of-the-week, which doesn't count. What I'm trying to say is, Booksmith newsletters are good for your life. If you are the kind of person who likes surprising bricks, or aggressive ostriches, or hearing about how my son is getting all sorts of bad ideas as he tears through the entire collection of Robert Newton Peck's&nbsp;[Soup](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/site/robert%20newton%20peck%20soup)&nbsp;books (most of the books, set in Depression-era Vermont, culminate with something like this: Soup and Rob's cobbled together wagon catches fire as it's careening down Dugan's Hill towards Main Street, where the whole town is out to celebrate after the hay-gathering, and the girls are all dressed up as haystacks, and the boys are each pushing wheelbarrows of manure for some reason, and soon there will be flaming children and manure, but it all works out because the wagon hits the old water tower and it collapses right on top of the giant tub of free bubble bath powder that was delivered there by mistake) maybe you should subscribe to it, and then you'll get that jolt of adrenaline each week. I promise, we never try to sell anything to anyone in here.

Thanks for reading,

Paul
