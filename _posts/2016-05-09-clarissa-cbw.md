If you spend time in our Children's Section you know that we will send you home with a stack of books as tall as you are, if given the chance.
<br>The Kids team figured that you see our names (Alex, Amy, Clarissa, and India) enough on the shelf talkers that crowd our beloved shelves, so for Children's Book Week 2016 we asked all the OTHER bookstore folks for *their* favorite children's books! &nbsp;

*picture book*

From the illustrator of the #1 smash hit [The Day the Crayons Quit](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780399255373) comes a whodunnit just right for the youngest of readers (not to mention instructions for how to build the perfect paper airplane)! The animals' homes are disappearing. Tree by tree, the forest is being cut down. Clues, there must be clues! For instance, look–there is a mysterious bear carrying an ax. But what would a bear want with so many trees? Perhaps the discarded paper airplanes littering the forest floor have a story to tell?
