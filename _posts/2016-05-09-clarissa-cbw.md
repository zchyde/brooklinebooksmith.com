If you spend time in our Children's Section you know that we will send you home with a stack of books as tall as you are, if given the chance.
<br>The Kids team figured that you see our names (Alex, Amy, Clarissa, and India) enough on the shelf talkers that crowd our beloved shelves, so for Children's Book Week 2016 we asked all the OTHER bookstore folks for *their* favorite children's books! &nbsp;

![](/uploads/versions/papercaper---x----315-400x---.jpg)[The Great Paper Caper](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780399250972) by [Oliver Jeffers](http://www.oliverjeffers.com/)

*picture book*

From the illustrator of the #1 smash hit [The Day the Crayons Quit](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780399255373) comes a whodunnit just right for the youngest of readers (not to mention instructions for how to build the perfect paper airplane)! The animals' homes are disappearing. Tree by tree, the forest is being cut down. Clues, there must be clues! For instance, look–there is a mysterious bear carrying an ax. But what would a bear want with so many trees? Perhaps the discarded paper airplanes littering the forest floor have a story to tell?

[Sweep](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780142417171) by Cate Tiernan

*young adult*

Morgan Rowlands never thought she was anything other than a typical sixteen-year-old girl. But when she meets Cal, a captivatingly handsome coven leader, she makes a discovery that turns her whole world upside down: she is a witch, descended from an ancient and powerful line. And so is Cal. Their connection is immediate and unbreakable; Cal teases out Morgan's power, her love, her magick. But Morgan discovers too soon that her powers are strong, almost too powerful to control. And she begins to suspect that Cal may be keeping secrets from her . . . secrets that could destroy them both.

[Ollie's Odyssey](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781442473553) by William Joyce

*intermediate fiction*

In the secret realm of toys, there are many mysteries. There is the Code of the Toys, which is as ancient as childhood. There's also the magic of becoming a child's favorite, the highest honor in the Toy World. Made by hand by Billy's mother, Ollie is a special toy, a toy who will matter. He becomes Billy's best friend, confidant, pal, and yes, Billy's favorite.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; But there are villains in the Toy World, and Zozo, the clown king, is the most feared. He and his toy henchman (the Creeps) have sworn to steal and imprison favorite toys until they forget their children and become forever lost.
<br>When Ollie is toynapped, Billy must rescue his beloved favorite from Zozo's subterranean lair in the old Carnival Place, past the park, through the woods, and into the night. Never has a journey of ten blocks been more epic.

![](/uploads/versions/swordandstone---x----273-400x---.jpg)[The Sword in the Stone](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780399225024) by T. H. White

intermediate fiction

Before there was a famous king named Arthur, there was a curious boy named Wart and a kind old wizard named Merlyn. Transformed by Merlyn into the forms of his fantasy, Wart learns the value of history from a snake, of education from a badger, and of courage from a hawk–the lessons that help turn a boy into a man. Together, Wart and Merlyn take the reader through this timeless story of childhood and adventure–"The Sword in the Stone."
<br>T.H. White's classic tale of the young Arthur's questioning and discovery of his life is unparalleled for its wit and wisdom, and for its colorful characters, from the wise Merlyn to the heroic Robin Wood to the warmhearted King Pellinore.
