If you spend time in our Children's Section you know that we will send you home with a stack of books as tall as you are if given the chance.
<br>The Kids Team figured that you see our names (Alex, Amy, Clarissa, and India) enough on the shelf talkers that crowd our beloved shelves, so for Children's Book Week 2016 we asked all the OTHER bookstore folks for *their* favorite children's books! &nbsp;

Children's Book Week might be over, but we celebrate our love of children's literature year round. So if you need a great recommendation, don't be shy, because we could go on all day.
