![](/uploads/versions/pumpkinlatte---x----356-278x---.jpg)This year's gentle turn from Summer to Fall is marked by the softening of the heat index, the emergence of long pants, and the White House edict (for real) stating that no American (not kidding) is allowed to show support or disapproval of pumpkin and/or spice. Keep it to yourself.
<br>
<br>But most important of all, the change of season also brings mountains ofamazing new gift books to the store! Beginning this week, our humble newsletter will be putting our most intriguing, most delectable, most show-stopping new gift books on display. Some people say its too early to start thinking about gift-giving…but those are the same people who will be panic-shopping on Black Friday while you kick back in your long pants with your piping hot mug of pumpkin spice latte.

<br>Not in market for a big new book, searching for something a little more humble? I just picked up James Rebanks' [The Shepherd's Life](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781250060266). I was surprised to find such a rich and full life contained within the strict set of boundaries imposed by his Lake District sheep farm. Rebank's choices - in writing as in life - to keep his palette restrained, his ancient practice unchanged, and his range limited, has kept him, in shepherd's terms, [hefted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKPpv9rA5Uk).

<br>Want to find a new vantage point on this little patch we call home? Booksmith's own Lydia McOscar is teaming up with GrubStreet to curate a series of personal essays from debut authors about our fair city of Boston. First up is [Louise Miller](https://www.grubstreet.org/blog/looking-for-the-one-a-writers-life-in-kitchens/), writing on baking, macrobiotics, and what "love at first sight" means to a chef. On the strength of her debut, [The City Baker's Guide to Country Living](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781101981207), and her wonderful reading right here at Booksmith over the summer, Miller is already beloved among the staff. Sign up to follow the [GrubStreet blog](https://www.grubstreet.org/blog/) to keep up with the series!
