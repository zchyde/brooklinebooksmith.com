An open letter addressed to the [PEN American Center](https://www.pen.org/) in March sparked controversy after its release to the public last week. The letter, which bears the signatures of 100+ writers, criticizes the organization for accepting sponsorship from the Israeli government. PEN-AC responded that it does not participate in cultural boycotts.

PEN, originally an acronym for "Poets, Essayists, Novelists," now extends to writers of any form of literature, such as playwrights, editors, journalists and historians. It is the world's oldest human rights organization and the oldest international literary foundation. The open letter released Wednesday addresses its American branch, specifically funding of the annual [World Voices Festival](https://worldvoices.pen.org/), and potentially puts PEN-AC at odds with its international counterparts. As [reported in the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/06/israeli-backing-for-new-york-festival-rejected-in-angry-letter-by-authors):

> Among the writers who have put their names to the protest are the former president and vice president of English PEN, Gillian Slovo and Kamila Shamsie; poet Eileen Myles; authors Louise Erdrich and Ahdaf Soueif; and the Palestinian writer Ahmad Qatamesh, whose imprisonment without charge by the Israeli government was [criticised by PEN International](https://www.pen.org/rapid-action/2011/05/25/writer-and-academic-detained-without-charge-0).

Protesters allege that PEN-AC's acceptance of funding from Israel ([festival programming](https://worldvoices.pen.org/2016-world-voices-supporters) credits the country's embassy as a "champion" level sponsor) aligns the literary institution with the Israeli government - a body whose record on artistic liberty and free speech is disputed by the letter's authors:

> "Given PEN American Center’s mission of supporting freedom of expression, it is deeply regrettable that the festival has chosen to accept sponsorship from the Israeli government, even as it intensifies its decades-long denial of basic rights to the Palestinian people, including the frequent targeting of Palestinian writers and journalists."

Author Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, chairperson of the 2016 World Voices Festival, and Jakab Orsos, PEN-AC's director, responded to the allegations in an email to members. Orsos and T&oacute;ib&iacute;n state that their organization does not participate in “cultural boycotts of any kind – which impede individual free expression – no matter the cause." They refer to [PEN-AC's formal policy](https://www.pen.org/press-release/2007/06/22/pen-american-center-urges-rejection-academic-boycotts):

> PEN… believes that literature, works of art, and ideas must remain common currency among people despite political or international upheavals, and that political and national passions should not prevent or interrupt intellectual and cultural exchange…
> <br>
> <br>We believe that such boycotts threaten the free expression rights not only of those associated with the boycotted institutions but also of those in the countries where the boycott is practiced, and that the universally guaranteed right of all to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas… includes the right to engage in direct, face-to-face discussions, debates, challenges, and collaborations.

The controversy comes a year after PEN-AC awarded the 2015 Freedom of Expression Courage Award to the cartoonists of French magazine Charlie Hebdo, drawing [criticism from a number of authors](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/29/writers-join-protest-charlie-hebdo-pen-award). Signatories of the recent letter include prominent literary figures Alice Walker, Angela Davis, and Junot D&iacute;az.
