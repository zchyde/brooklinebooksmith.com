Kidsmith is celebrating Halloween in style this month. In addition to our decked-out displays of Halloween-themed picture books and activity books, we've also got a couple things happening for older kids and teens. <br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QkSnEYedQWI/VhqZPR0PyCI/AAAAAAAAAK8/3bQtj4yA-sc/s1600/IMG_1379.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QkSnEYedQWI/VhqZPR0PyCI/AAAAAAAAAK8/3bQtj4yA-sc/s320/IMG_1379.JPG" width="240" /></a></div><br /><b>FIRST: </b>Readers who like to take a chance can grab one of our bookseller-selected mystery reads from our TRICK OR TREAT YOURSELF display. (If any of you enjoyed our Blind Date With A Book display this February, come in for a second round!) These are some of our favorite wickedly creepy books for middle grade and young adult readers. Don't you trust us?<br /><br /><br /><b>SECOND: </b>K-12 readers, let us know the name of your favorite scary book, and be entered to win free advance copies of this year's best and scariest MG/YA books! We'll be drawing our winners on Halloween. (Check out the great and various books people have picked so far on the pumpkins all over our display.)<br /><br />Head back to the tree in the kids' section to find our display! <br /><br />Even with all this going on, the kids' booksellers still haven't been able to talk enough about some of our favorite recent Halloween-y books. Here are a few more titles that you might want to check out.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AmuH-l1fybk/Vhqa68n9kKI/AAAAAAAAALI/Xkjk8PRjxEg/s1600/IMG_1428.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AmuH-l1fybk/Vhqa68n9kKI/AAAAAAAAALI/Xkjk8PRjxEg/s320/IMG_1428.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Intermediate</b></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">OUR FAVORITE: <i>The Nest</i> by Kenneth Oppel. The best horror stories have something true right at the center of them, and this book does that exquisitely. It's about an anxious boy with a sick little brother, being asked in his dreams by sentient wasps to just...maybe...let them...<i>replace</i>...his brother with a better one, a healthier one. Despite the fear factor and the big themes, this one is good for grade-schoolers and parents alike.<br /><br />MORE RECOMMENDATIONS:<br /><i>A Curious Tale of the In-Between</i> by Lauren DeStefano</div><i>Took</i> by Mary Downing Hahn<br /><i>Hoodoo </i>by Ronald L. Smith <br /><i>The Hollow Boy</i> by Jonathan Stroud<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /><b>Young Adult </b></div><br />OUR FAVORITE: <i>The Accident Season</i> by Moira Fowley-Doyle is the story of a family that, each October, suffers an unusual storm of accidents, from the minor to the fatal. Hiding beneath the cuts, burns, and bruises, the bubble-wrapped tables and the plaster casts, are the bitter secrets of a family--one that has failed to keep itself safe so badly that now, once a year, everything is dangerous. This book gets dark, but its ghostly atmosphere and fiercely devoted characters will draw you through to the end.<br /><br />MORE RECOMMENDATIONS:<br /><i>Nightfall</i> by Jake Halpern and Peter Kujawinski<br /><i>The Fall</i> by Bethany Griffin<br /><i>Witch's Boy </i>by Kelly Barnhill<br /><br /><br />Lastly, for those younger princesses, goatherds, and mighty warriors among you, don't forget to join us on Sunday, October 18th at 2 PM for our PRINCESS IN BLACK party, celebrating the second book in our favorite chapter book series! Feel free to dress up, and look forward to crafts and fun!
