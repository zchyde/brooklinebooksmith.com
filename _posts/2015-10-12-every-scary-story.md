Kidsmith is celebrating Halloween in style this month. In addition to our decked-out displays of Halloween-themed picture books and activity books, we've also got a couple things happening for older kids and teens.  

[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QkSnEYedQWI/VhqZPR0PyCI/AAAAAAAAAK8/3bQtj4yA-sc/s320/IMG_1379.JPG)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QkSnEYedQWI/VhqZPR0PyCI/AAAAAAAAAK8/3bQtj4yA-sc/s1600/IMG_1379.JPG)

**FIRST:** Readers who like to take a chance can grab one of our bookseller-selected mystery reads from our TRICK OR TREAT YOURSELF display. (If any of you enjoyed our Blind Date With A Book display this February, come in for a second round!) These are some of our favorite wickedly creepy books for middle grade and young adult readers. Don't you trust us?  

**SECOND:** K-12 readers, let us know the name of your favorite scary book, and be entered to win free advance copies of this year's best and scariest MG/YA books! We'll be drawing our winners on Halloween. (Check out the great and various books people have picked so far on the pumpkins all over our display.)  

Head back to the tree in the kids' section to find our display!  

Even with all this going on, the kids' booksellers still haven't been able to talk enough about some of our favorite recent Halloween-y books. Here are a few more titles that you might want to check out.

**Intermediate**

OUR FAVORITE: _The Nest_ by Kenneth Oppel. The best horror stories have something true right at the center of them, and this book does that exquisitely. It's about an anxious boy with a sick little brother, being asked in his dreams by sentient wasps to just...maybe...let them..._replace_...his brother with a better one, a healthier one. Despite the fear factor and the big themes, this one is good for grade-schoolers and parents alike.  

MORE RECOMMENDATIONS:  
_A Curious Tale of the In-Between_ by Lauren DeStefano

_Took_ by Mary Downing Hahn  
_Hoodoo_ by Ronald L. Smith  
_The Hollow Boy_ by Jonathan Stroud  

**Young Adult**

OUR FAVORITE: _The Accident Season_ by Moira Fowley-Doyle is the story of a family that, each October, suffers an unusual storm of accidents, from the minor to the fatal. Hiding beneath the cuts, burns, and bruises, the bubble-wrapped tables and the plaster casts, are the bitter secrets of a family--one that has failed to keep itself safe so badly that now, once a year, everything is dangerous. This book gets dark, but its ghostly atmosphere and fiercely devoted characters will draw you through to the end.  

MORE RECOMMENDATIONS:  
_Nightfall_ by Jake Halpern and Peter Kujawinski  
_The Fall_ by Bethany Griffin  
_Witch's Boy_ by Kelly Barnhill  

Lastly, for those younger princesses, goatherds, and mighty warriors among you, don't forget to join us on Sunday, October 18th at 2 PM for our PRINCESS IN BLACK party, celebrating the second book in our favorite chapter book series! Feel free to dress up, and look forward to crafts and fun!
