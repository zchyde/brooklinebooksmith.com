[Lois Lane: Fallout](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781630790059) is a YA novel about amazingly wonderful teenager Lois Lane moving to Metropolis, joining the Daily Planet’s experimental student arm, and immediately putting it at jeopardy by threatening the big, the bad, the powerful, and their crafty weapon design program that uses zombiefied teenage virtual reality MMORPG players as guinea pigs.

It is kind of like reading the book distillation of Veronica Mars (or iZombie, maybe?) plus Batman Beyond. There is peril, there is bravado, there is technologically questionable science, there is THIS MYSTERIOUS AND CHARMING PERSON ON THE INTERNET WHO ONLY GOES BY SMALLVILLEGUY. I really love these things, you guys. They make such a fun book together. SUCH a fun book.

Also, THERE IS GOING TO BE A SEQUEL.

But Lois is not the only mystery-solving girl in the world of kid/YA fiction. There are more, and they are so wonderful, and you should read about all of them.

**~~ENCYCLOPEDIA BROWN~~ GIRL DETECTIVE**

[*Cam Jansen*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780142401781) series by David A. Adler – Even more than [Nate the Great](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780440461265), Cam Jansen introduced me to mystery stories. She is one cool character. Also, she has a photographic memory, which I pretended I also had for about two years after my first Cam Jansen book. You can find her BOTH in our leveled readers and in First Chapter Books.

[*The Scandalous Sisterhood of Prickwillow Place*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781596439566) by Julie Berry – I think I threw this at every gift-buying adult shopping for a 9-13 year old that I met in November and December. This is the completely delightful and very funny story of a Victorian girls’ school after the headmistress and her brother die mysteriously one night at dinner. With these two buried in the back garden, the girls are free for the first time ever! But someone is going to find those bodies…and someone killed them to begin with.

*[Hawkeye](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780785183907)* by Matt Fraction et. al. – Yessss, at last a Marvel comic gets onto one of my blog posts. *Hawkeye* is about two Hawkeyes: the sad Clint Barton man Hawkeye, and the exceptionally perfect, sublime, and superior Hawkeye Kate Bishop. The first two books are about both of them (and you should read them, because they completely rethink what superhero comics are allowed to do, and are beautiful), but in book three, Kate is all on her own. How does that go? We just got this series into the store, and I am so stoked about it.

*[Nancy Drew](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/site/carolyn%20keene)* series by Carolyn Keene – THE CLASSIC. We have the first couple books in stock in Intermediate fiction, as well as some volumes of three different spinoff series in our First Chapter Books section! You may also find some vintage books in our Used Book Cellar, in various states of expurgation.

[*Scarlet Undercover*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316283939) by Jennifer Latham – What is this?! A black Muslim orphan girl detective? OH YES. If you like Gwenda Bond’s Lois Lane, you will definitely love Scarlet, whose gradeschool client is absolutely right in thinking that her brother is up to something really, really not quite right.

[*The Westing Game*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780140386646) by Ellen Raskin – Okay, I’ve DEFINITELY written about this before, but come on! Halloween, dead millionaires, an underwhelming girl named Turtle who is secretly (not that secretly–how could you love any character more than Turtle?) the very, very best, and a delicious ending that is probably only one small part of what got this book its Newbery.

[*Sammy Keyes*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780679892649) series by Wendelin Van Draanen – I ate these up so fast in middle school. Sammy is just the coolest and best. Her adventures are always action-packed, the plots are quirky, and at least one of them involves nuns. You can sometimes find a few of the books used downstairs, sold only, I imagine, in a truly desperate moment by their former owners.

In conclusion: if you have other favorite girl detectives, please immediately tell me everything.
