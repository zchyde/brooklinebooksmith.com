Hullo Initiates!<br /><br />One of the perks to working in such a brilliantly established bookstore is that we get all sorts of goodies sent to us. Posters, advanced copies, bookmarks stickers, the occasional tee-shirt. Sometimes we fight over them. Sometimes our buyer claims them before we even get to see them (she has a habit of hiding all Oliver Jeffers that appear.) Sometimes the "adults" decide that if we can't play nice no one can have them.<br /><br />Sometimes we decide to be nice. <br /><br />This is, begrudgingly, one of those nice times. <br /><br /><br />Mostly because couple of months back the Kidsmith team started a <a href="https://twitter.com/kidsmithbooks">twitter</a>. We have a lot of enthusiasm and could only express so much of it before we started to alarm customers. We needed an outlet. <br /><br />Twitter seemed an appropriate platform. It allows us to be fast and enthusiastic but still limited in length.<br /><br />And we are enthusiastic and we are excited each and every time that we gain a new follower. We appreciate that you are willing and eager to read our thoughts so we wanted to do something in return.<br /><br />Which leads me to...<br /><br />GIVING A THING AWAY!<br /><br />We were sent this really awesome poster for the Insurgent movie that comes out on Thursday.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HwdYdEfThFU/VQXIk6gccqI/AAAAAAAAAvk/wcd-myT2Vsk/s1600/WP_20150315_13_34_09_Pro.jpg" height="640" width="356" />&nbsp;</td><td style="text-align: center;"></td><td style="text-align: center;"></td><td style="text-align: center;"></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">See, it's brilliant!</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><br /></td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><br /></td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><br /></td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><br /></td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-h4imTSx_wzs/VQXQdTUbwPI/AAAAAAAAAv0/WreYUoNCywg/s1600/WP_20150315_13_36_01_Pro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-h4imTSx_wzs/VQXQdTUbwPI/AAAAAAAAAv0/WreYUoNCywg/s1600/WP_20150315_13_36_01_Pro.jpg" height="640" width="356" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">It loves you even if you don't love the movies.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />While I wouldn't mind hanging it up in my room, the wall space is devoted mostly to bookshelves. Also, I won the battle for the giant poster of the Allegiant cover so...<br /><br />Anyway! We decided that it would be pretty cool to do a giveaway to all of you wonderful people!<br /><br />A couple of months back the Kidsmith team started a <a href="https://twitter.com/kidsmithbooks">twitter</a>. We have a lot of enthusiasm and could only let so much of it out before we started to alarm customers. We needed an outlet. <br /><br />Twitter seemed an appropriate platform. It allows us to be fast and enthusiastic but still limited in length.<br /><br />And we are enthusiastic and we are excited each and every time that we gain a new follower. We appreciate that you are willing and eager to read our thoughts so we wanted to do something in return.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the giveaway is only open to those in the U.S. at the moment (sorry).<br /><br />So check it out and enter below!<br /><br />&nbsp;<a class="rcptr" data-raflid="567bb7e41" data-template="" data-theme="classic" href="http://www.rafflecopter.com/rafl/display/567bb7e41/" id="rcwidget_o48xgivc" rel="nofollow">a Rafflecopter giveaway</a><br /><br />&nbsp;Who knows if this goes well maybe we'll do another giveaway.
