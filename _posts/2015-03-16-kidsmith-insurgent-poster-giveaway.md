Hullo Initiates!  

One of the perks to working in such a brilliantly established bookstore is that we get all sorts of goodies sent to us. Posters, advanced copies, bookmarks stickers, the occasional tee-shirt. Sometimes we fight over them. Sometimes our buyer claims them before we even get to see them (she has a habit of hiding all Oliver Jeffers that appear.) Sometimes the "adults" decide that if we can't play nice no one can have them.  

Sometimes we decide to be nice.  

This is, begrudgingly, one of those nice times.  

Mostly because couple of months back the Kidsmith team started a [twitter](https://twitter.com/kidsmithbooks). We have a lot of enthusiasm and could only express so much of it before we started to alarm customers. We needed an outlet.  

Twitter seemed an appropriate platform. It allows us to be fast and enthusiastic but still limited in length.  

And we are enthusiastic and we are excited each and every time that we gain a new follower. We appreciate that you are willing and eager to read our thoughts so we wanted to do something in return.  

Which leads me to...  

GIVING A THING AWAY!  

We were sent this really awesome poster for the Insurgent movie that comes out on Thursday.

See, it's brilliant!

It loves you even if you don't love the movies.


While I wouldn't mind hanging it up in my room, the wall space is devoted mostly to bookshelves. Also, I won the battle for the giant poster of the Allegiant cover so...  

Anyway! We decided that it would be pretty cool to do a giveaway to all of you wonderful people!
