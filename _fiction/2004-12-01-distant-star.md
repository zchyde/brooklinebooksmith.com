The star of Roberto Bola単o's hair-raising novel *Distant Star* is Alberto Ruiz-Tagle, an air force pilot who exploits the 1973 coup to launch his own version of the New Chilean Poetry, a multi-media enterprise involving sky-writing, poetry, torture, and photo exhibitions. For our unnamed narrator, who first encounters this "star" in a college poetry workshop, Ruiz-Tagle becomes the silent hand behind every evil act in the darkness of Pinochet's regime. The narrator, unable to stop himself, tries to track Ruiz-Tagle down, and see signs of his activity over and over again. A corrosive, mocking humor sparkles within Bola単o's darkest visions of Chile under Pinochet. In Bola単o's world there's a big graveyard and there's a big graveyard laugh. (He once described his novel *By Night in Chile* as "a tale of terror, a situation comedy, and a combination pastoral-gothic novel.") Many Chilean authors have written about the "bloody events of the early Pinochet years, the abductions and murders," Richard Eder commented in *The New York Times*: "None has done it in so dark and glittering a fashion as Roberto Bola単o."
