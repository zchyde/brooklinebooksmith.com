Inspired by one of the finest lyrics in the English language, the anonymous, pre-Shakespearean Tom O'Bedlam: "...by a knight of ghosts and shadows I am summoned am to tourney Ten leagues beyond The wide world's end–– Methinks it is no journey..." Kenneth Patchen sets off on an allegorical journey of his own in which the far boundaries of love and murder, madness and sex are sensually explored. His is the tale of a disordered pilgrimage to H. Roivas (Heavenly Savior) in which the deranged responses of individuals point up the outer madness from which they derive in a more imaginative way that social protest generally allows. A chronicle of violent fury and compassion, written when Surrealism was still vigorous and doing battle with psychotic "reality," *The Journal of Albion Moonlight *is the American monument to engagement. Like Camus, Kenneth Patchen is anti-cool, anti-hip, anti-beat. Henry Miller said: "*The Journal of Albion Moonlight* is a work of unmistakable genius. Nothing like it has been written...in all English literature it stands alone... I know of no other American writer capable of giving us such a...truthful, fearless and harrowing account...*Albion Moonlight* is the most naked figure of a man I have encountered in all literature."
