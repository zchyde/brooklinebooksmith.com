Championed by Salman Rushdie in *The New Yorker*, Qurratulain Hyder is one of the "must reads" of Indian literature. *Fireflies in the Mist* is Hyder's capstone to her astonishing *River of Fire*, which was hailed by *The New York Review of Books* as "magisterial with a technical resourcefulness rarely seen before in Urdu fiction." *Fireflies* follows the creation of modern day Bangladesh – from Indian province, to Partition, to the emergence of statehood – as told through the impassioned voice of Deepali Sarkar and the others around her who live through the turbulence. Hyder perceptively and majestically follows the trajectory of Sarkar's life – from her secluded upbringing in Dhaka to becoming a socialist rebel and to her ultimate transformation as a diasporic Bengali cosmopolitan – in the way that many of yesterday's revolutionaries are slowly but surely ensnared within a net of class and luxury dangled in front of them.
