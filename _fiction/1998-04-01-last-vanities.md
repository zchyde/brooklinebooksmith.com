“Reading time is approximately four hours. Remembering time, as for its author, the rest of one's life,” said Joseph Brodsky of Fleur Jaeggy's novel, *Sweet Days of Discipline*. Now Jaeggy has come up with seven stories, each at some deep level in dark complicity with the others, all as terse and spare as if etched with a steel tip. A brooding atmosphere of horror, a disturbing and subversive propensity for delirium haunts the violent gestures and chilly irony of these tales. Full of menace, the air they breathe is stirred only by the Föhn, the warm west wind of the Alps that inclines otherwise respectable citizens to vent the spleen and angst of life's last vanities.
