This gathering of all Dylan Thomas's stories, ranging chronologically from the dark, almost surrealistic tales of Thomas's youth to such gloriously rumbustious celebrations of life as *A Child's Christmas in Wales* and *Adventures in the Skin Trade*, charts the progress of "The Rimbaud of Cwmdonkin Drive" toward his mastery of the comic idiom. Here, too, are stories originally written for radio and television and, in a short appendix, the schoolboy pieces first published in the *Swansea Grammar School Magazine*. A highpoint of the collection is Thomas's *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog*, a vivid collage of memories from his Swansea childhood that combines the lyricism of his poetry with the sparkle and sly humor of *Under Milk Wood*. Also here is the fiction from *Quite Early One Morning*, a collection planned by Thomas shortly before his death. Altogether there are more than forty stories, providing a rich and varied literary feast and showing Dylan Thomas in all his intriguing variety â€” somber fantasist, joyous word-spinner, comedian of smalltown Wales. The book includes an entertaining, informative reflection on Thomas by another Welsh poet and storyteller, Leslie Norris, as well as a brief listing of publication details by Professor Walford Davies, editor of* Dylan Thomas: Early Prose Works*.
