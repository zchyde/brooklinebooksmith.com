H.D.'s *Nights* is about one woman's attempt to get to the essence of her bisexuality and failed marriage through an illicit heterosexual affair––an attempt that eventually ends in suicide. Much like a mystery novel, we are given the clues to the writer Natalia Saunderson's death: a muff and watch left beside a frozen pond and two parallel skating lines that meet. Following her drowning, Natalia's manuscripts, a kind of experimental diary, are delivered to a publisher friend, and they provide the details which lay bare the often painful story.
