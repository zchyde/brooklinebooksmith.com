Called by its author a “false novel,” *Dark Back of Time* begins with the tale of the odd effects of publishing *All Souls*, his witty and sardonic 1989 Oxford novel. *All Souls* is a book Marias swears to be fiction, but which its "characters"––the real-life dons and professors and bookshop owners who have "recognized themselves––fiercely maintain to be a roman á clef. With the sleepy world of Oxford set into fretful motion by a world that never "existed," Marías further stirs things up by weaving together autobiography (the brother who died as a child; the loss of his mother), a legendary kingdom, strange ghostly literary figures, maps and photographs, halls of mirrors, a one-eyed pilot, a bullet lost in Mexico, and a curse in Havana. Dark Back of Time has been acclaimed here as "superb" (*Review of Contemporary Fiction*), "fantastically original" (*Talk*), "brilliant" (*Virginia Quarterly Review*), and "a rare gift" (*The New York Times Book Review*). "In the best manner of Borges," *The Hudson Review* commented, this hybrid is "lush and mysterious." Javier Marias, translated into thirty-four languages, has sold over four million copies of his books worldwide, and won a dazzling array of awards.
