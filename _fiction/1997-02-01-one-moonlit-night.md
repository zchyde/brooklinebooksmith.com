Caradog Prichard's *One Moonlit Night*, first published in 1961, is a Welsh literary masterpiece: "one of the most impressive novels to be published in Wales since the Second World War" (*The Oxford Companion to the Literature of Wales*). Just recently translated from the Welsh into English, *One Moonlit Night* recalls the pathos and beauty of Dylan Thomas's *Under Milkwood*. Told from the standpoint of a compassionate young boy coming of age in a small North Welsh village, much of the novel is autobiographical: the author's hometown, Bethesda, a childhood under the shadow of World War I, the boy's depressed, ailing mother and his heartbreaking empathy for her. The novel is told with a remarkable shifting between formal narrative and local dialect, the young narrator recounting moments in his life with poetic language and tenderness. But it is with a catastrophic act of madness that the novel culminates, carried out, in the words of H. Pritchard Jones, "to the accompaniment of a De Profundis-like psalm, an invocation of all the mother figures in the narrator's own life."
