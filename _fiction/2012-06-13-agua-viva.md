A meditation on the nature of life and time, *Água Viva* (1973) shows Lispector discovering a new means of writing about herself, more deeply transforming her individual experience into a universal poetry. In a body of work as emotionally powerful, formally innovative, and philosophically profound as Clarice Lispector's, *Água Viva* stands out as a particular triumph.
