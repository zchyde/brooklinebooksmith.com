Eavesdroppers, failed bodyguards, night doctors, forgers, liars, suicides, assassins, and ghosts populate the dozen stories of *When I Was Mortal*. "In the space of ten or twenty pages," as the *Nouvel Observateur* remarked, "Marías contrives to write a novel." "The short story fits Marías like a glove," as *Le Point* noted, and these stories have been acclaimed as "formidably intelligent" (*The London Review of Books*); and "startling" (*The New York Times Book Review*); "a refreshing discovery... [they] should be welcomed here like a bracing tonic" (*The Chicago Tribune*).
