A spectacular finale, *Poison, Shadow and Farewell* brings to a close Javier Marías's daring, unfolding three-part novel *Your Face Tomorrow*. Marías's magnum opus has already been acclaimed "exquisite" (*Publishers Weekly*), "gorgeous" (*Kirkus*), and "outstanding: another work of urgent originality" (London Independent). With its heightened tensions between meditations and noir narrative, *Poison, Shadow and Farewell* takes our hero, Jacques Deza––hired by a shady branch of M16 as a person of perception––back to Madrid to spy on and try to protect his own family, as he plunges into new depths of love and loss.
