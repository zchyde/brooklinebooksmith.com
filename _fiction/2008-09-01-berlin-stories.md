*The Berlin Stories *is a book comprising two short novels by Christopher Isherwood: *Goodbye to Berlin* and *The Last of Mr. Norris*. The two novellas are set in Berlin in 1931, just as Adolf Hitler was moving into power. Berlin is portrayed by Isherwood during this transitional period of cafes and quaint avenues, grotesque nightlife and dreamers, and powerful mobs and millionaires. Sally Bowles is the protagonist who experiences her share of misadventures along with Mr. Norris, Fr√§ulein Schroeder, and the Landauers. *The Berlin Stories* was the starting point for the John Van Druten play *I Am a Camera*, which in turn went on to inspire the film *I Am a Camera* as well as the stage musical and film versions of *Cabaret*.
