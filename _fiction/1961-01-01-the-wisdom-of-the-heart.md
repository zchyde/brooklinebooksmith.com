This selection of stories and essays shows again the wide range of mood, style and subject matter which Henry Miller commands. Expressing himself with exhilarating candor and freedom, writing ‘from the heart’ with a refreshing lack of reticence, Miller involves the reader directly in his thoughts and feelings. “His real aim,” Karl Shapiro has written, “is to find the living core of our world whenever it survives and in whatever manifestation, in art, in literature, in human behavior itself. It is then that he sings, praises, and shouts at the top of his lungs with the uncontainable hilarity he is famous for.” Including some of Henry Miller’s best-known writings, here are essays on Raimu, the film star; Brassai, the photographer; and E. Graham Howe, the psychoanalyst. In “Reflections on Writing,” Miller examines his own position as a writer. In “Seraphita” and “Balzac and His Double,” he applies himself to the work of another writer. Among other selections are “The Alcoholic Veteran,” “Creative Death,” ”The Enormous Womb,” “The Philosopher Who Philosophizes.” Many of Henry Miller’s books, including *The Henry Miller Reader*, are published in hardbound editions by New Directions. His book on Greece, *The Colossus of Maroussi*, the books of stories, essays and prose pieces *The Cosmological Eye*, *Remember to Remember* and S*unday After the War*, and Miller’s study of Rimbaud, *The Time of the Assassins* are all available in the New Directions Paperbook series.
