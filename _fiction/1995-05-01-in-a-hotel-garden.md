*In a Hotel Garden* is a provocative work by the English novelist once described by Sir Frank Kermode as "an admirable and rare example of the writer-critic." It is a captivating novella, written almost entirely in dialogue. *In a Hotel Garden* unfolds character and meaning with a lovely, meditative tension. The narrator Ben relates to his friends his enthralling encounter with a Jewish woman in the Dolomite Alps. The tale of her compulsive visit to a hotel garden in Siena––where her grandmother fell in love with a man soon to be a victim of the Holocaust––illuminates Ben's half-lived life, and raises the question of how we can ever come to terms with the destruction of the European Jews in our century. *The Independent* in England (where this novel first appeared) said, “Its [the novel's] enigmas are those of life itself, and Josipovici sets them before us with clarity, tact and compassion.”
