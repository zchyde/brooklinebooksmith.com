For forty-two years the poet William Carlos Williams was a practicing physician in a typical American town in New Jersey. And, as Van Wyck Brooks points out in his introduction to this collection of Dr. Williams' stories, the doctor "did not treat a man [only] as something to which surgery and drugs applied" but "as material for a work of art." This point of view produced a dozen or more stories which are true masterpieces, and in all of Williams' stories there is a vitality and an immediacy unique in American fiction. This volume gathers together fifty-two stories from earlier books, *The Knife of the Times *(1932), *Life Along the Passaic River* (1938), and *Make Light of It* (1950), and includes as well the great long story, *The Farmers' Daughters*, completed in 1956.
