Now available for the first time as a paperbook, *Quetzalcoatl* is D.H. Lawrence's last "unpublished manuscript" and the early version of D.H. Lawrence's great Mexican novel, *The Plumed Serpent*. Kate Burns is the widow of a failed Irish patriot, strong-minded and independent, who unlike the heroine of *The Plumed Serpent*, refuses to simply join the Mexican revolutionary movement based on a revival of the Aztec gods. *Quetzalcoatl* is arguably one of Lawrence's most feminist works: the rise of a revolution filtered through the consciousness of a woman of tremendous individuality. This edition includes an illuminating introduction and textual commentary by Sterling Professor of English at Yale, Louis Martz. "*The Plumed Serpent*," Martz says, "may be judged a success wtihin its own mode of existence. For a different sort of novel, we may turn now to *Quetzalcoatl*."
