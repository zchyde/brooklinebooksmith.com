William Saroyan, who burst upon the scene with his celebrated short-story collection *The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze* (1934), enjoyed a long and prolific literary career. Famous for his novels and plays (including *The Human Comedy* and *The Time of Your Life*), he also published sixteen acclaimed story collections. "It came as something of a shock then, after the author's death in 1981," the editor Leo Hamalian notes, "to realize Saroyan hadn't published a collection of his stories since 1956, a period of twenty-five years that also represents a full half of his writing life." Gathered here are the finest of the masterly late pieces which appeared in *The New Yorker*, *Atlantic Monthly*, and *Harper's *in the 1960s and '70s.
