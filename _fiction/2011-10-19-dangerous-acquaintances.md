Written in the 1780s, *Dangerous Acquaintances* is a compelling story of intrigue and war between the sexes. The Marquis de Merteuil and her ex-lover the Viscomte de Valmont find revenge in a series of seductions carried out with wit and ingenuity.  While seeming partners, they are engaged in a struggle for supremecy that gives the novel great vitality.  *Dangerous Acquaintances* appeals today because of a dissection of human motives and portrayal of vice in high society that seem incredibly contemporary.  It was the basis of a French film that caused a furor in France upon its release, was refused an export visa (because of 'perversity') and subsequently banned entirely.
