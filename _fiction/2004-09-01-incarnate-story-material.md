Thalia Field's new book explores the very condition of being incarnate: how, invested with human form, we experience both suffering and ecstasy from childhood to adulthood to death. As with her previous book *Point and Line* (2000), *Incarnate* defies categorization: written in a variety of poetic and prose-like forms, it "industriously works the sparsely populated and as yet underdeveloped borderlands between poetry, fiction, theater" (*Review of Contemporary Fiction*). As Carole Maso says in the *American Book Review*, Thalia Field is "playful, subversive, and intense." In *Incarnate: Story Material*, she continues to reach beyond borders, examining how, trapped in our own stories, we act and react in a world we make solid, perceiving something "other" close at hand.
