PICTURE-BOOKS:

- title: INTERSTELLAR CINDERELLA by Deborah Underwood, illustrated by Meg Hunt
  ISBN: 9781452125329
  description: "This spirited retelling retains Cinderella's classic structure, but capable mechanic Cinderella meets the prince when she repairs his spaceship, and she loses a wrench instead of a glass slipper. The illustrations swirl and sparkle through the cosmos. Read-aloud friendly rhyming text carries everyone to a happy ending: Interstellar Cinderella is too young for marriage, but she's old enough to be the royal chief mechanic! A great fit for fans of princesses and Rosie Revere, Engineer."

- title: SING A SEASON SONG by Jane Yolen and illustrated by Liesl Ashlock
  ISBN: 9781568462554
  description: "Jane Yolen's quiet lullaby, set to the rhythm of the changing seasons, explodes into brilliant full color in Ashlock's sharply detailed illustrations. As plants and animals of the woods and fields traverse the year, you can also catch glimpses of a few far-off childrenâ€”the natural world is always close by, if you're willing to look. The story starts and ends in snug and sleepy winter, while vibrant images of summer will be especially welcome on cold nights."

INTERMEDIATE-FICTION:

- title: THE NEST by Kenneth Oppel, illustrated by Jon Klassen
  ISBN: 9781481432320
  description: "Anxiety-ridden Steve can hardly stand to think about his sick newborn brother. Then a white wasp comes to Steve in a dream with an offer: let this little brother go. The wasps will make a new one. A better one. He only has to say yes. Klassen's illustrations augment the papery creepiness of the story (chapter headings are marked by a growing swarm of wasps), but it's the courage and love bursting from this book that make it a staff favorite."

- title: GEORGE by Alex Gino
  ISBN: 9780545812542
  description: "George is a pretty normal fourth-grade girl. She likes clothes and friends. She's dying to be Charlotte in her class production of Charlotte's Web. The only thing that's different about George is that no one knows she's a girl. Not her teachers, her family, or her friends. But George wants that to change. Alex Gino's debut stars a strong-minded, good-hearted, totally believable protagonist, a transgender girl who's ready to be seen by the world as she sees herself."

- title: DOLDRUMS by Nicholas Gannon
  ISBN: 9780062320940
  description: "A unique and whimsical story that is just begging to be read out loud. Characters reminiscent of Roald Dahl, with quirky humor and the best round about logic. Who doesn't get in shape for an Arctic Expedition by eating as much ice as possible? The author also created stunning full color illustrations that perfectly highlight the setting of this brilliant new classic."
