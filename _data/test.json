The International Criminal Court (ICC), the only permanent international criminal tribunal with a mandate to investigate and prosecute the international atrocity crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and aggression, is the preeminent historical achievement in international criminal justice.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAt present 123 nations have ratified the Rome Statute and are members of the ICC Assembly of States Parties. While the US played a central role in the establishment of the Rome Statute that created the ICC, the US is not a State Party. Building upon positive developments at the end of the George W. Bush administration, the US-ICC relationship has significantly progressed during the Barack Obama administration, with the US providing varied and important support to the Court to the fullest extent allowed under existing US law.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The following timeline chronicles the U.S. role in international criminal justice, the creation of the ICC, and the evolution of US-ICC relations from its beginnings to present day.</strong>\n</p>",
