### Some of Our Favorite Listens


**Homegoing**, by Yaa Gyasi

[![](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55395080e4b03e1f32a4dbe2/t/576c70cee4fcb5bcdb3bb8fc/1466724735970/?format=500w)](https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9780451484185-homegoing?bookstore=Brookline Booksmithjp) “Homegoing is more than just a compelling read, it's an experience. It does what fiction does at its very best--it takes us outside of ourselves to bare witness to the lives of others so we can understand our world and each other. The characters are so vivid, so alive, and the writing is miraculous. Gyasi, at 26, is a genius. I had the immense pleasure of meeting Gyasi at BEA in Chicago, and I really can't wait to put this phenomenal book in your hands.”

**—Kate Layte**, owner + manager

“This novel beautifully traces the devastating realities of racism from Ghana to a modern America. Spanning generations, the thread of memory connects all of the incredibly drawn characters in this moving novel.”

**Sex Object**, by Jessica Valenti

[![](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55395080e4b03e1f32a4dbe2/t/576c710d59cc68e22a3179fe/1466724695471/?format=500w)](https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9780062471642-sex-object?bookstore=Brookline Booksmithjp) “Guardian US columnist and feminist icon Jessica Valenti has done amazing work in her new book SEX OBJECT, which explores every day effects of misogyny in a patriarchal society. This memoir is a much needed depiction of what it means to be a woman in a man's world. While it can be infuriating to read and remember that women are exploited every day, it is comforting to remember that there are brave women at the front-lines of discussing the issues. Valenti's fierce style, incredible wit, and unwavering honesty make this book a must-read for all.”
