#### What is the SFE club?

The Signed First Editions Book Club (SFE) is a subscription for newly released books autographed by their authors. Membership is either ongoing or limited to three (3), six (6) or twelve (12) months. We can hold a signed first edition for you to pick up in the store every month or have it delivered to your doorstep for an additional fee. Each book comes with a clear jacket cover that ensures the shelf life of your collection.

#### Why join the SFE?

First and foremost, you get the benefit of our experience! If you shop at Brookline Booksmith you’re used to checking out our favorites, be they from the Staff Picks corner, our “Books We Love” table or the dozens of hand-written recommendations lining our shelves. If there is one thing that gets us giddier than the books we carry, it’s the books that haven’t come out yet and that we can’t wait to share with you. The SFE is our chance to give you the scoop on the next big thing – because what booksellers are reading today, critics are writing about tomorrow. Not only that, but your signed first edition is a personal connection to the author and will be the pride of your library for years to come – there’s just something about seeing that signature and knowing the hand that made it is shaping minds all over the world.

#### How much does SFE membership cost?

There are two options:

1. Pickup Plan - $29.00/month: you receive an email when your signed book is available for pickup at your earliest convenience.
2. Delivery Plan - $36.00/month: your signed book is mailed to you each month via USPS Media Mail.


Both plans charge your credit card automatically every month on the date you initially signed up (although book availability/shipment dates vary – see below). You can subscribe for 3, 6, or 12 months, or become an ongoing member. Charges cease at the end of your enrollment.

#### How do I join?

Subscribe [here](#subscribe)&nbsp;and simply choose how many months you'd like to enroll: you can do three (3), six (6), twelve (12), or ongoing. (Ongoing plans can be canceled, all other plans are extendable by request).

#### What will I get?

Each month you receive one signed first edition in a protective jacket cover, a note from the bookseller who selected your title, and our heartfelt gratitude for your continued support.

#### What is a first edition?

A first edition is the first printing of a book, and the closest edition in time and intent to the author's original work. Bestselling titles soon move on to subsequent versions with revised text, award stamps or movie poster covers, but the first edition remains the most sought after by collectors and bookworms alike.

#### How are the books chosen?

Most selections are a part of our acclaimed Writers & Readers event series. In other cases titles are recommended by booksellers with an eye to literary merit, diverse new voices and trailblazing perspectives. The members of our selections committee are among the most experienced in the industry, unwavering in their hunt for fresh work that raises the bar for contemporary literature.

#### Can I pay with cash/gift card/store credit?

No - this program is separate from our regular, in-store payment system. Payment is done by credit card only, via PayPal.

#### Can I pay the entire cost up-front or in-store?

No. See previous question.

#### Can I apply my discount (WGBH, Coolidge etc.)?

Sorry, no discounts apply.

#### Can I get my signed book personalized by the author?

If the SFE book of the month is by an author in our events series, personalizations are possible but never guaranteed. Contact Tim Huggins by email at [sfe@brooklinebooksmith.com](mailto:sfe@brooklinebooksmith.com) with specific inquiries. Personalized books are non-returnable.

#### Can I give someone a membership to the SFE as a gift?

Of course! Just specify the shipping address of the recipient when you sign up. You can also include a short message in the comments field to accompany the first month's book (e.g. “Rock on! Love, Grandma.”)

#### Will I know what books I’m getting ahead of time?

Yes, we announce authors and titles in advance.

#### Can I select which months/titles I want?

No. Each book choice is linked to a specific month, and monthly plans are consecutive – in other words, no skipping around.

#### Can I return or opt-out of an SFE selection?

While there are no opt-out priviledges, returns are no problem. Our store policy accepts books in their original unread condition (with the exception of personalized copies, which are nonreturnable.) Once we receive your return we credit a refund to the card on your SFE account. For people in our delivery plan who have any questions or concerns about returns, please email [sfe@brooklinebooksmith.com](mailto:sfe@brooklinebooksmith.com).

#### Can I attend ticketed readings by SFE authors?

Yes, although seating is limited and can't be guaranteed. No more than one complimentary ticket per subscriber. Your book will not be available for pick-up the same night as the event. For further event-related inquiries or if you'd like to attend a ticketed reading please email Tim Huggins at [sfe@brooklinebooksmith.com](mailto:sfe@brooklinebooksmith.com) as early as possible.

#### When will I receive my books?

The date you receive or can pick up your book varies from month to month, depending on publisher release dates and the schedule of our author visits. We send you these availability dates via email as soon as we know them, and Delivery Plan books are shipped immediately.

#### What if I have a question that's not answered here?

Feel free to email Tim Huggins ([sfe@brooklinebooksmith.com](mailto:sfe@brooklinebooksmith.com)) with any questions or for more information.
