Brookline Booksmith opened its doors in 1961 as Paperback Booksmith with the slogan "Dedicated to the fine art of browsing." And for more than 50 years the Booksmith has been exactly that. Constantly changing with the neighborhood around it, Brookline Booksmith has served the people of Brookline and Boston with its eclectic mix of titles, literate and helpful staff, and seemingly neverending schedule of book signings, talks and poetry readings.

Come visit! Listen to an author speak at our Readers & Writers Series; read and subscribe to our award-winning newsletter; join our monthly book club (going strong after 10 years!); browse the stacks, both new and used; peruse the always changing Card & Gift Room; check out our popular staff picks; or ask a bookseller for a recommendation. You'll see why Brookline Booksmith has been a standard-bearer for independent bookselling, winning the ABA's Bookstore of the Year in 1998, and Best of Boston from _Boston_ magazine in 7 of the last 9 years.
