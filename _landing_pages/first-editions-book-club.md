Just the facts, ma'am:

**What it is**: The Signed First Editions Club (SFE) is like a book of the month club, with a twist â€“ every book is a first edition (produced in limited quantities) and signed by the author. The dust jacket gets a protective cover to keep everything pristine and collectible for your home library. Plus, these titles are our personal picks!

**What you do**: Sign up online (www.brooklinebooksmith.com/sfe) and choose how many months you'd like to enroll: you can do three (3), six (6), twelve (12), or ongoing. (Ongoing plans can be canceled, all other plans are extendable by request).

**What we do**: Read a ton of books (we do this part anyway) and give our most anticipated picks to a committee of experienced buyers and author event coordinators. A spirited debate ensues and one stellar forthcoming title wins the day. We order first editions from the publisher and arrange to have them signed ahead of time or in-store during visiting author readings. After that each book gets its own protective cover and a tucked-in personal note from a bookseller introducing the month's choice. Depending on your plan, we either pack your book up to be shipped or set it aside for you to pick up at our counter.

**Money stuff**: You can either pay $29.00/month for our Pickup Plan, where you collect your prepaid book in-store at your convenience, or $36.00/month for the Delivery Plan, where we ship books straight to you (or a gift recipient). We bill your card for the flat fee once a month on the 15th. Payment takes place via our website.

**Other stuff**: You can find the more detailed explanations and more on our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list. For further help or lively conversation our SFE point man Tim Huggins can be reached at 617.739.6660 during regular business hours or by email at [sfe@brooklinebooksmith.com](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(115,102,101,64,98,114,111,111,107,108,105,110,101,98,111,111,107,115,109,105,116,104,46,99,111,109)+'?subject=Signed%20First%20Editions%20Book%20Club')).
