In-store events take place in our downstairs Readers and Writers Room, which can hold up to 150 people. The Coolidge Corner Theatre directly across the street is available to us on most weeknights for ticketed events with theatres seating 220 or 440 people. We also have relationships with larger venues in Boston ranging from 500 to 1,200+ seats. See below for details and images of in-store and offsite venues.

Events are promoted on social media (12,200 Twitter followers, 9,300 Facebook Likes, 2,450 Instagram followers), our weekly B-Mail newsletter (7,500 subscribers), our in-store events posters, on a sandwich board in front of the store, and on flyers with events listings placed in every customer's bag. Event books are always displayed in the front windows leading up to the event and if the publisher provides cover blow-ups we hang them over the front registers. We also send out a bi-monthly press release to media outlets and our events are listed in *The Boston Globe* and other publications. We are a *New York Times* reporting store.

### Brookline Booksmith Store Level (Upstairs Signing Only)

![](http://images.brooklinebooksmith.com/event-venues/Brookline-Booksmith-Upstairs/BB-Upstairs-1-compressor.jpg) **Capacity Signing Only**: 750 best to date.

**Recent Events**: Mindy Kaling, Neil Patrick Harris, Grace Helbig, Joey Graceffa, Bill Nye, Sara Bareilles, Ree Drummond.

**Recent Success Notes**: The biggest signing-only event we’ve hosted was 750 books for Youtuber Joey Graceffa. Our other biggest signing-only events had attendance capped by the publisher. These include Neil Patrick Harris (600 books in under three hours), Jeff Kinney (500 people with kids activity stations) and Mindy Kaling (400 people in under two hours). Staff members are always available to take pictures, but we also have a great relationship with a professional photographer who can take customers’ pictures and upload them to a website immediately after the event. We’ve perfected our setup for a standard signing line and have a wristband system in place for distributing pre-signed books.

### Coolidge Corner Theatre Event Space

![](http://images.brooklinebooksmith.com/event-venues/Coolidge-Corner-Theatre/Coolidge-Corner-Theatre-1-compressor.jpg) **Capacity**: Moviehouse 1 can hold 440; Moviehouse 2 can hold 220.

**Recent Events**: Michael Chabon, Jhumpa Lahiri, Richard Ford, Junot Diaz, Felicia Day, John Waters, Caroline Kennedy, Judy Blume, Brandon Sanderson, Christopher Moore, Joe Perry of Aerosmith.

**Recent Success Notes**: Coolidge events usually have sales of 200+ frontlist units for Moviehouse 1 and 100+ for Moviehouse 2. We’ve recently had sold-out events for Brandon Sanderson and Felicia Day. They had exemplary sales with 410 hardcovers sold for Felicia Day (MH1) and 211 hardcovers sold for Brandon Sanderson (MH2). After our Coolidge event with Joe Perry of Aerosmith, his manager told me, “You ran the best event of the tour with the worst people….” (meaning troublesome fans, not us). The Coolidge is directly across the street from the store and post-Coolidge signings are held at Brookline Booksmith. The signings are open to all, giving us the opportunity to sell books to non-ticketholders if the theater is sold-out.

### Berklee Performance Center Event Space

![](http://images.brooklinebooksmith.com/event-venues/Berklee/Berklee-1-compressor.jpg) **Capacity**: 1,215 (732 Orchestra Level + 432 Balcony Level).

**Recent Events**: Elvis Costello in conversation with Peter Guralnick.

**Recent Success Notes**: We sold 900 ticket/book bundles for Elvis Costello’s memoir in October. The Performance Center is a beautifully designed space with terrific acoustics. From the back row of the top balcony you still have a great view of the stage and can hear every word. Their technical setup is extraordinary and they make a great partner for promoting music-related books. Beyond the Performance Center, Berklee has several smaller rooms and will soon make a 500-seat theater available to us.

### Wilbur Theatre Event Space

![](http://images.brooklinebooksmith.com/event-venues/Wilbur-Theater/Wilbur-1-compressor.jpg) **Capacity**: 1,200.

**Recent Events**: Lena Dunham, Nick Offerman, Rainn Wilson.

**Recent Success Notes**: The Wilbur is very collaborative in their marketing strategies and are eager to use their connections as Boston’s preeminent comedy theatre to promote our events. Beyond our events being promoted alongside theirs on their website and print advertising, they’ve gone so far as to feature our events on digital billboards along the highway, and use their marketing team to help coordinate radio interviews and promotional giveaways.

### Congregation Kehillath Israel

**Capacity**: 100-1,000.

**Past Events**: Jonathan Safran Foer, Amy Tan and many more.

**Recent Notes**: We have not had occasion to use this space in the past year, but I recently met with their rabbi and he is eager to resume our partnership. There are three events spaces: a chapel that seats 100; an open room with a stage that can seat 200; and the main worship space which seats 400-500 and can be arranged to seat up to 1,000, if the balcony is used.
