Forget everything you've been taught about dieting. In *Always Hungry*?, renowned endocrinologist and leading Harvard Medical School expert Dr. David Ludwig explains why traditional diets don't work, and presents a radical new plan to help you lose weight without hunger, improve your health, and feel great. Low-fat diets work against you by triggering fat cells to hoard more calories for themselves, leaving too few for the rest of the body. *Always Hungry?*turns dieting on its head with a program that ignores calories and targets fat cells directly. This is dieting without deprivation.
