From the editor-in-chief of io9.com comes a stunning novel about the end of the world—and the beginning of our future. Childhood friends Patricia Delfine and Laurence Armstead didn't expect to see each other again. After all, the development of magical powers and the invention of a time machine could hardly fail to alarm one's peers and families. But now they're both adults and the planet is falling apart around them. Little do they realize that something bigger than either of them is determined to bring them together—to either save the world, or plunge it into a new dark ages.
