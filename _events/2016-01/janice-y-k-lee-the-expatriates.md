Janice Y. K. Lee’s blockbuster hit debut *The Piano Teacher* was called “immensely satisfying” by *People*; “intensely readable” by *O, The Oprah Magazine*; and “a rare and exquisite story” by Elizabeth Gilbert. Now, in her long-awaited new novel, Lee explores with devastating poignancy the emotions, identities, and relationships of three very different American women living in the same small expat community in Hong Kong.
