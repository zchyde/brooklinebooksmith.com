In this magisterial biography, Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award winner T. J. Stiles paints a portrait of Gen. George Custer both deeply personal and sweeping in scope, proving how much of Custer’s legacy has been ignored. In the Civil War, the West, and many areas overlooked in previous biographies, Custer helped to create modern America, but he could never adapt to it. *Custer’s Trials* casts surprising new light on a near-mythic American figure, a man both widely known and little understood.
