*NeuroLogic* explores the brain’s internal system of reasoning and illuminates our most outlandish as well as our most stereotyped behaviors. From sleepwalking murderers, contagious yawning, and the brains of sports fans, to false memories, subliminal messages, and the secret of ticklishness, Dr. Eliezer Sternberg shows that there are patterns to the way we interpret the world—patterns that fit the brain’s unique logic.
