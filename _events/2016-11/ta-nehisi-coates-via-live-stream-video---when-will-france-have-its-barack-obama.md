What made President Obama's rise possible? Could a similar figure come to power in France? Live-streaming from Albertine Bookshop in NY, Ta-Nehisi Coates - best-selling author of Between the World and Me - leads a discussion on French politics, race and identity; with guests Pap Ndiaye, Benjamin Stora, Iris Deroeux & Jelani Cobb. Join us for this special PAGE & SCREEN collaboration with the Coolidge Corner Theatre!&nbsp;**This event is free of charge but requires tickets, available through the Coolidge Corner Theatre at**

All right, I have sent the cards to fedex, to collect them I would wait about 3-4 days, then you go to the fedex place and say "Hello I'm picking up for Brookline Booksmith, also could be under the name Zoe Hyde". They should get the cards for you and have you sign for them. They will supply you with a long receipt, which I believe Tim is supposed to get, but no one ever asked me for fedex receipts the whole time I was there. Still, I held on to them, just in case.

IF: They ask you what the project name is, you can say "business cards" and that will be sufficient. This step isn't even for them, so it doesnt really matter. They may not even ask.

IF: They ask you to pay, this is a mistake. Their training leaves something to be desired, and sometimes new people will attempt to charge me personally for the projects, despite the fact that everything should be charged to a card that's on file with them. Say you'd like to charge it to the card on the account. If there is a problem, call me.&nbsp;
