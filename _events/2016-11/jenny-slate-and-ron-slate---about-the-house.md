The Slate family’s rambling colonial house just outside of Boston may be haunted, but it’s definitely full of surprises. Kitchen and bedrooms, yard and garden – all trigger memories from brilliant actress and comedian Jenny Slate and her father, renowned poet and essayist Ron Slate. In *About the House*, the Slates share their family stories, memories, quirks, and confessions in a singular collection of stories, essays, and poems that range from profound to profane. Remarkably touching, often hilarious, and unfailingly human, this unusual father-daughter dialogue takes a look at family like no other work since...well, since nothing else.
