The Slate family’s rambling colonial house just outside of Boston may be haunted, but it’s definitely full of surprises. Kitchen and bedrooms, yard and garden – all trigger memories from brilliant actress and comedian Jenny Slate and her father, renowned poet and essayist Ron Slate. In *About the House*, the Slates share their family stories, memories, quirks, and confessions in a singular collection of stories, essays, and poems that range from profound to profane. Remarkably touching, often hilarious, and unfailingly human, this unusual father-daughter dialogue takes a look at family like no other work since…well, since nothing else. &nbsp;Beautifully illustrated by Karl Stevens (*Boston Phoenix, Village Voice*) who will also be in attendance.&nbsp;

*About the House* will be distributed for free at this reading. The Concord Free Press asks only that you make a donation to a charity you support or give money to someone in need, then pass the book on. The first ten books published by the CFP have inspired more than $1 million in generosity around the world. Copies of *About the House* will be limited to the first 50 customers in line.
