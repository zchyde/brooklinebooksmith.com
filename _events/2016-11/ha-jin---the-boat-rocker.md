From the*National Book Award*-winning author of *Waiting* and *War Trash*: *The Boat Rock**er* is a brilliant, darkly funny story of corruption, integrity, and the power of the pen. New York, 2005. Chinese expatriate Feng Danlin is a fiercely principled reporter whose expos&eacute;s have made him legendary among readersâ€”and feared by Communist officials. But his newest assignment may be his undoing: investigating his ex-wife, an unscrupulous novelist who has willingly become a pawn of the Chinese government in order to realize her dreams of literary stardom.
