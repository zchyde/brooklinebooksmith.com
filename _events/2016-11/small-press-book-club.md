Read something off the beaten path! Our Small Press Book Club discusses a book published by an independent press. Free and open to the public, meeting the third Monday of every month at 7:00pm. To contact our moderator, email smallpress@brooklinebooksmith.com

This month we will be discussing ***Colonel Lágrimas*** by Carlos Fonseca.
