In celebration of Elena Ferrante's first collection of nonficiton, ***Frantumaglia***, join best-selling novelist **Claire Messud**, Vogue book critic Megan O’Grady**, Elena Ferrante’s U.S. publisher Michael Reynolds**, her translator **Ann Goldstein**, and WBUR’s **Christopher Lydon**, host of Radio Open Source, for an evening of conversation about the elusive author of the ***Neapolitan Quartet***.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>***Frantumaglia&nbsp;***invites readers into Elena Ferrante’s workshop. It offers a glimpse into the drawers of her writing desk, those drawers from which emerged her three early standalone novels and the four installments of&nbsp;***My Brilliant Friend****,* known in English as th*e **Neapolitan Quartet***. Consisting of over 20 years of letters, essays, reflections, and interviews, it is a unique depiction of an author who embodies a consummate passion for writing.
