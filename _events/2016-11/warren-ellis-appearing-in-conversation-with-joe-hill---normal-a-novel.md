Some people call it "abyss gaze." Gaze into the abyss all day and the abyss will gaze into you. There are two types of people who think professionally about the future: Foresight strategists who think about ways to evade Our Coming Doom; and strategic forecasters, who think about ways to prepare for Our Coming Doom. It's something you can't do for long. The abyss gaze takes hold. A smart, tight, provocative techno-thriller straight out of the very near future *Normal* calls into question the core principles of how and why we think about the future--and the past, and the now. **Warren Ellis will appear in conversation with Joe Hill (*NOS4A2, The Fireman*).**
