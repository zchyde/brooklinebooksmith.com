***Brighton*** is an extraordinary thriller—gripping, haunting, and marvelously told—about two friends growing up in a rapidly changing Boston, who must face the sins of their past in the midst of a series of brutal murders.

***In We Were Kings***, the Irish Republican Army is running guns and killing witnesses in 1950's Boston. *Serpents in the Cold* introduced us to Cal and Dante. This time they must descend into Boston's shadowy underbelly to discover a terrorist plot that will shake the city to its core.
