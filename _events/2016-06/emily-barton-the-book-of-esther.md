What if an empire of Jewish warriors that existed in the Middle Ages had never fallen—and was the only thing standing between Hitler and his conquest of Russia? Simultaneously a steampunk Joan of Arc and a genre-bending tale of a counterfactual Jewish state by a writer who invents worlds “out of Calvino or Borges” (*The New Yorker*), The Book of Esther reaffirms Emily Barton’s place as one of her generation’s most gifted storytellers.
