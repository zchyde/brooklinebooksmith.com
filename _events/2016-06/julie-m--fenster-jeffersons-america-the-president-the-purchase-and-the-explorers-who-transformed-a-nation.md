Thomas Jefferson was responsible for orchestrating the American push into the continent.. He most famously recruited Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, who led the Corps of Discovery to the Pacific, but at the same time there were other teams who did the same work, in places where it was even more crucial.*Jefferson’s America* rediscovers the robust and often harrowing action from these seminal expeditions and illuminates the president’s vision for a continental America.
