Tucker taking his nine-year-old cousin Maria sledding should have been a nice outing. But by the end of the crisp December morning Maria is kidnapped, her mother is dead, and her mafia don father has been arrested for murder. Searching for Maria through sub-zero days and nights, Tucker persists even as his relentless efforts draw him into a deadly crossfire between every power-hungry crook in Boston.
