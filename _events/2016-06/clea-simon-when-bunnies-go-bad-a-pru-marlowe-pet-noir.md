Bad-girl animal psychic Pru Marlowe lives in a world where only her crotchety tabby Wallis knows the whole truth about her past and her unique gift that surfaced abruptly one day. Yet when Pru discovers a murdered tourist and his girlfriendâ€™s high-maintenance spaniel falls to her care, she gets dragged into a complicated case of crime and punishment that involves some new friends, an old nemesis, and her own shadowed past.
