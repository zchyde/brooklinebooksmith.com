In ***When Bunnies Go Bad***, bad-girl animal psychic Pru Marlowe lives in a world where only her crotchety tabby Wallis knows the whole truth about her past and her unique gift that surfaced abruptly one day. When Pru discovers a murdered tourist and his girlfriendâ€™s high-maintenance spaniel falls to her care, she gets dragged into a case of crime and punishment that involves her own shadowed past.

<br>In ***Nantucket Grand***, poetry-writing Police Chief Henry Kennis must face a series of disturbing incidents that rock the small resort island of Nantucket during a long winter. When spring turns to summer and the tourists flood the island, the mysterious cycle of violence spins faster. &nbsp;Could all of these events be part of the same sinister conspiracy? . Henry, putting his own life at stake, must take desperate action to set things right and save the world-his world-the little comma of scrub pine and dune grass he has come to call home.
