Late one summer night, Elizabeth Sanderson receives the devastating news that every mother fears: her thirteen-year-old son, Tommy, has vanished without a trace. Elizabeth is wholly unprepared for the strange series of events that follow. She believes a ghostly shadow of Tommy materializes in her bedroom. As the search grows more desperate, and the implications of what happened become more sinister, no one is prepared for the shocking truth about that night and Tommy’s disappearance at Devil’s Rock.
