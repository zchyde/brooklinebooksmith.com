You followed *The Passage*. You faced The Twelve. Now enter *The City of Mirrors* for the final reckoning. The Twelve have been destroyed and the terrifying hundred-year reign of darkness that descended upon the world has ended. The survivors are daring to dream of a hopeful future. But far from them, in a dead metropolis, he waits: Zero. The First. Father of the Twelve. One last time light and dark will clash, and at last &nbsp;Amy and her friends will know their fate.
