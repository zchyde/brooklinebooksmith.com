Join us for a night of noir with two authors whose work illuminates the forgotten corners of Appalachia. ***Ridgerunner*** finds wildlife conservation officer Matt Rider at odds with members of the renegade Pittman family in a rural Pennsylvania that’s been ravaged by the natural gas industry. Heading south to a bitterly benighted, mine-polluted corner of Virginia, ***Nitro Mountain*** follows a group of people bound together by alcohol, small-time crime and music.
