As the 1960s drew to a close, the United States was coming apart at the seams. From August 1969 to August 1970, the nation witnessed nine thousand protests and eighty-four acts of arson or bombings at schools across the country. Clara Binghamâ€™s unique oral history of that tumultuous time unveils anew that moment when America careened to the brink of a civil war at home, as it fought a long, futile war abroad.
