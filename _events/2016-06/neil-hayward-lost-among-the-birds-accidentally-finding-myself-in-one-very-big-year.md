Early in 2013 Neil Hayward, current board director for the Brookline Bird Club, was at a crossroads after quitting an unfulfilling job. So he went birding. His growing list of species reluctantly catapulted him into a Big Yearâ€“a race to find the most birds in one year. Neil shocked the birding world by finding 749 species of bird and breaking the long-standing Big Year record. He also surprised himself, finding a renewed sense of confidence and hope about the world and his place in it.
