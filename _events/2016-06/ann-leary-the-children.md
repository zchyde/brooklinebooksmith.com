Charlotte Maynard rarely leaves her motherâ€™s sprawling Connecticut lake house. When Spin, the youngest and favorite of her siblings, brings his fianc&eacute; home for the summer, the entire family is intrigued. But as the wedding draws near, an array of simmering resentments and unfortunate truths are exposed. With remarkable wit and insight, Ann Leary pulls back the curtain on one blended family, as they are forced to grapple with the assets and liabilities left behind by their wonderfully flawed patriarch.
