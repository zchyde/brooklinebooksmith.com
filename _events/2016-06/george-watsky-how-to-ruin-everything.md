In this brutally honest and humorous debut, musician and artist George Watsky chronicles the small triumphs over humiliation that make life bearable and how he has come to accept defeat as necessary to personal progress. The essays in *How to Ruin Everything* range from the absurd (how he became an international ivory smuggler) to the comical (his middle-school rap battle dominance) to the revelatory.

Lin-Manuel Miranda, composer and lyricist of *Hamilton: An American Musical*, calls *How to Ruin Everything*, â€œFunny, subversive, and able to excavate such brutally honest sentences that you find yourself nodding your head in wonder and recognition."
