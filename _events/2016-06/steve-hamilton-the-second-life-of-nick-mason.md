From *New York Times-bestselling*, two-time Edgar-award-winning author Steve Hamilton comes an unforgettable new hero. Nick Mason has already spent five years inside a maximum security prison when an offer comes that will grant his release twenty years early. Whenever his cell phone rings, day or night, Nick must answer it and follow whatever order he is given. He accepts -- but the deal comes with a terrible price.
