Vaudeville manager, boxing promoter, stock swindler, card shark and self-proclaimed "Jade King of China," Freeman Bernstein was a master of exuberant excess and no stranger to the hard-hand of the law. But the charges he was arrested for in 1937 were more serious than those he had ever encountered before; Adolf Hitler claimed that Bernstein had committed fraud against the German government. A thrilling and page-turning read, *Hustling Hitler* is the untold story of the larger-than-life, eternal hustler who changed the course of history.
