In ***Saving Hamlet***by Molly Booth, a rift in space-time puts teenager Emma Allen in charge of stage-managing her drama club’s production of Hamlet…but also Shakespeare’s debut in 1601! Booth’s debut is a revelry of time travel, theatre, and romance.

Jen Malone’s ***Wanderlost*** is the story of Aubree, a girl with boring plans for the summer until she assumes her sister’s identity and takes over her job leading a tour of seniors across Europe–and there’s budding romance, too, but how do you admit a crush under an alias?

The star of Jaye Robin Brown’s debut novel ***Georgia Peaches and Other Forbidden Fruit*** is Joanna, a southern girl who’s out and proud until a move to a new town prompts her preacher father to ask her to go back in the closet. Joanna agrees, until she meets the perfect girl and things get more difficult.
