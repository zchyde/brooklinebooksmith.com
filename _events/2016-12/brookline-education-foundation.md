The Brookline Education Foundation was one of the country’s first local education foundations supporting public elementary and secondary schools. The Ernest R. Caverly Award recognizes teaching excellence, and has been awarded to fifty-eight teachers, from the preschool level through high school. Each winner is asked to deliver a talk about their experiences in the classroom and their journey to get there. This book is a collection of eighteen of those talks. Join us as teachers in this collection read from their speeches and reflect on the craft of teaching.
