*The Pilgrim* is a ten-times-a-year literary magazine from the homeless community of downtown Boston, edited by *The Atlantic* columnist James Parker and published out of the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, on Tremont Street. Since its founding in December 2011, *The Pilgrim* has featured the work of more than sixty homeless, transitional or recently housed writers. The master metaphor of the magazine is pilgrimage, and its proposition to the reader is that homelessness is a state of acute pilgrimage, &shy; a condition of material and occasionally moral emergency, and thus a place where the world reveals itself under the pressure, or the pouring-in, of a higher reality.
