Hiking and rafting for four friends becomes a nightmare when an accident leaves the women stranded. As night descends, a fire on the mountainside lures them to a camp. But as the friends grasp the true intent of their supposed saviors, long buried secrets emerge and lifelong allegiances are put to the test.
