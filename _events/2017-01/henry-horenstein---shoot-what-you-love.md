Henry Horenstein learned to “shoot what you love” and he’s done so for four decades, capturing photographs that evoke older cultures and places - especially ones that are disappearing. Horenstein brings these images together in this rich visual memoir, along with behind-the-scenes stories, insights, and tips for fellow photographers.
