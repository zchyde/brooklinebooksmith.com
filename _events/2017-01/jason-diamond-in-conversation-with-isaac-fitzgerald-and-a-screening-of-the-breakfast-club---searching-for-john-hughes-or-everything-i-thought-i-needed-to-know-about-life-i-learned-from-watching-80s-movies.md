For all fans of John Hughes and his hit films such as&nbsp;*Sixteen Candles*&nbsp;and&nbsp;*The Breakfast Club*, comes Jason Diamond’s hilarious memoir of growing up obsessed with the filmmaker’s movies. In&nbsp;*Searching for John Hughes*, Jason tells how a kid from a broken home in Chicago found comfort in the likewise broken lives seen in Hughes’ oeuvre. Following the movie Jason will appear in conversation with author Isaac Fitzgerald (*Knives & Ink*).
