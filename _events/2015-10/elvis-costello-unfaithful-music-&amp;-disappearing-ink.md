*Unfaithful Music & Disappearing Ink*, written entirely by Elvis Costello, offers his unique view of his unlikely and sometimes comical rise to international success, with diversions through the previously undocumented emotional foundations of some of his best known songs and hits of tomorrow. The book contains many stories and observations about his renowned cowriters and co-conspirators, though Costello also pauses along the way for considerations of the less appealing side of infamy. Elvis Costello will appear in conversation with one of Americaâ€™s leading cultural historians and music critics, Peter Guralnick.
