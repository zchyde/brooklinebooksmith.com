Even as a child, Chaya Deitsch felt that she didn’t belong in the Hasidic world into which she’d been born. Upon attending Barnard College, she discovered a wider world in which she could establish an independent identity filled with secular knowledge and culture. With honesty, sensitivity, and intelligence, Chaya Deitsch movingly shows us that lives lived differently do not have to be lives lived apart.
