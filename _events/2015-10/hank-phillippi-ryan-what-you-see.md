Why would a father abduct his own child? A wedding is planned in Jane Ryland’s family, but there’s a calamity instead. Nine-year-old Gracie has been taken by her stepdad. Is the girl in danger? In her newest ripped from her own headlines Jane Ryland and Jake Brogan thriller, Ryan explores the terrifying realities of today’s constant surveillance and the dire consequences to those unwittingly in the spotlight.
