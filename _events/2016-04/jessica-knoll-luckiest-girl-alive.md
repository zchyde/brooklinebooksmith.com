An instant New York Times bestseller, now nominated for an Edgar Award, Luckiest Girl Alive was one of the breakout thrillers of 2015. With a singular voice and twists you won’t see coming, it explores the unbearable pressure that so many women feel to “have it all” and introduces a heroine whose sharp edges and cutthroat ambition have been protecting a scandalous truth, and a heart that's bigger than it first appears.
