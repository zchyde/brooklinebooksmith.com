From the author of The Dante Club, Matthew Pearl, The Last Bookaneer is the astonishing story of literary thieves’ epic final heist. London, 1890—Pen Davenport is the most infamous bookaneer in Europe always looking for the latest manuscript to steal. On the island of Samoa, a dying Robert Louis Stevenson labors over a new novel. Soon Davenport sets out for the South Pacific island where his longtime adversary, the monstrous Belial, appears triggering a conflict larger, perhaps, than literature itself.
