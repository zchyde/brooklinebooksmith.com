**Appearing in conversation with Erin Bowman**

Princess Wilhelmina is ready for her crown, but declaring herself queen means war. Her magic is uncontrollable and now there’s a living boy made of wraith—destructive and deadly, and willing to do anything for her. In this stunning conclusion to The Orphan Queen, Jodi Meadows follows Wilhelmina’s breathtaking journey from orphaned criminal on the streets to magic-wielding queen. Jodi will appear in conversation with Erin Bowman, author of the Taken trilogy.
