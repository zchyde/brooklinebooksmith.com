**Appearing in conversation with Erin Bowman**

Princess Wilhelmina is ready for her crown, but declaring herself queen means war. Her magic is uncontrollable and now there’s a living boy made of wraith—destructive and deadly, and willing to do anything for her. In this stunning conclusion to *The Orphan Queen*, Jodi Meadows follows Wilhelmina’s breathtaking journey from orphaned criminal on the streets to magic-wielding queen. Jodi will appear in conversation with Erin Bowman, author of the *Taken* trilogy.
