Beginning in Africa and ending in Europe, *Incarceration Nations*&nbsp;is a first-person odyssey through the prison systems of the world. Professor, journalist, and founder of the Prison-to-College-Pipeline, Dreisinger looks into the human stories of incarcerated men and women and those who imprison them, creating a jarring, poignant view of a world to which most are denied access, and a rethinking of one of Americaâ€™s most far-reaching global exports: the modern prison complex.
