From Jesse Andrews, author of the *New York Times* bestselling *Me and Earl and the Dying Girl*, comes a groundbreaking young adult novel about music, love, friendship, and freedom. For Wes and his best friend, Corey, jazz camp turns out to be lame. It’s pretty much all dudes talking in Jazz Voice. But then they jam with Ash, a charismatic girl with an unusual sound, and the three just click. Before Wes and Corey know it, they’re in Ash’s SUV heading south, and *The Haters* Summer of Hate Tour has begun!
