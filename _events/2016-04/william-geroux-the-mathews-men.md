From the late 1930s to 1945, virtually all the fuel, food and munitions that sustained the Allies in Europe traveled in merchant ships. After Pearl Harbor, those unprotected ships instantly became the U-boatsâ€™ prime targets. The Mathews Men tells that heroic story through the experiences of one family whose seven sons, U.S. merchant mariners all, suddenly found themselves squarely in the cross-hairs of the U-boats bearing down on the coastal United States in 1942.
