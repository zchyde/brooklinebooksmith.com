At 28, Jessica Fechtor was happily immersed in graduate school and her young marriage, and thinking about starting a family. Then one day an aneurysm burst in her brain. She nearly died. She lost her sense of smell, the sight in her left eye. Jessica’s journey to recovery began in the kitchen as soon as she was able to stand at the stovetop and stir. There, she drew strength from the restorative power of cooking and baking. Stir is an exquisite memoir about how food connects us to ourselves, our lives, and each other.
