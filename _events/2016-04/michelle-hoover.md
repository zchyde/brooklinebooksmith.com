Join us for a discussion on perspective in fiction and to celebrate Michelle Hooverâ€™s new novel Bottomland. Told in the voices of the family patriarch and his children, Bottomland follows the Hess family in the years after World War I as they attempt to rid themselves of the Anti-German sentiment that left a stain on their name. Christopher Castellani, an award-winning novelist and the artistic director of GrubStreet, will join Michelle to discuss his new nonfiction book, The Art of Perspective, a fascinating discussion on what form a narrator in literature should take.
