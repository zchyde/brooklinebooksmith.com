From New York Times-bestselling author Philip Kerr, the much anticipated return of Bernie Gunther in a series hailed by The Daily Beast as "the best crime novels around today." The war is over and Bernie Gunther is now living on the French Riviera. As Gunther fans know, all roads lead back to the viper’s nest that was Hitler’s Third Reich and it’s not long before Bernie’s retirement is disrupted by a blackmailed W. Somerset Maugham and Cold War spies lurking behind every palm tree.
