Forty-one years old, disenchanted wife and dutiful mother, Mayumi is a librarian on an island off the coast of New England. Her most erotic pleasure is in reading. That is, until the day she issues a library card to a shy seventeen-year-old boy who captivates her in a way that no one else ever has. Exquisitely written and compulsively readable, Mayumi and the Sea of Happiness is equal parts wry confession and serious meditation. In The Pathless Sky, Chaitali Sen conjures a world in which a nationâ€™s political turmoil, its secret history, and a growing social unrest turn life into a fragile thing and love into a necessary refuge to be defended at all costs. A world not unlike the one we live in.
