In chronicling the development and demise of the different relationships he's had while living in New York, Augusten Burroughs examines what it means to be in love, what it means to be in lust, and what it means to be figuring it all out. With Augusten's unique and singular observations and his own unabashed way of detailing both the horrific and the humorous, *Lust & Wonder* is an intimate and honest memoir that his legions of fans have been waiting for.

**This event will take place at the Coolidge Corner Theatre and require tickets.&nbsp;**
