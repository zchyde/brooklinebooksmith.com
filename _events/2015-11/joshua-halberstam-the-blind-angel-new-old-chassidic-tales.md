For twenty-five years, Rabbi Tovia Halberstam, a scion of leading Chassidic dynasties, told riveting Chassidic tales to an audience of thousands on the Yiddish radio in New York. In The Blind Angel, Rabbi Halberstamâ€™s son, Joshua Halberstam, renders these stories for a contemporary audience while maintaining the full charm, rhythm, and authenticity of the original tales.
