*Extraordinary Rendition* brings together the work of sixty-five prominent writers to examine Americaâ€™s culpability in the denial of human rights and dignity to Palestinians. In writing that is always clear, and often startlingly beautiful, contributors including Colum McCann, George Saunders and Alice Walker cover a range of issues that challenge the narrative about Palestine that has taken hold in the United States. We will be joined by contributors Askold Melnyczuk, Adam Stumacher, Alice Rothschild and Claire Messud.
