For more than fifty years, the world’s top scientists searched for the “missing” planet Vulcan, whose existence was mandated by Isaac Newton’s theories of gravity. There was just one problem: it was never there. It took Albert Einstein to discern that the mystery of the missing planet was a problem of Newton’s theory of gravity itself. Tom Levenson tells the tale of how the “discovery” of Vulcan in the nineteenth century set the stage for Einstein’s breakthrough, the greatest individual intellectual achievement of the twentieth century.
