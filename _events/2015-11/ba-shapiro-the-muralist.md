From the author of the New York Times bestseller The Art Forger comes a thrilling new novel that traces the life and mysterious disappearance of a brilliant young artist on the eve of World War II. Entwining the lives of both historical and fictional characters, and moving between the past and the present, The Muralist plunges readers into the divisiveness of prewar politics and the largely forgotten plight of European refugees refused entrance to the United States.
