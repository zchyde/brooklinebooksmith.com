Warren Zanes discusses his new book, Petty: The Biography, with Bill Janovitz, one of the founding members of the band Buffalo Tom. In the mid-eighties, rock icon Tom Petty invited then-22-year-old Warren Zanes and his band, the Del Fuegos, to open for him and the Heartbreakers on a three-month summer tour. At the time, Zanes never would have guessed that 30 years later he would pen Petty’s biography with the artist’s full cooperation and unguarded honesty.
