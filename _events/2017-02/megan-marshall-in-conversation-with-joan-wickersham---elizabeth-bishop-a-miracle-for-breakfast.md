Since her death in 1979, Elizabeth Bishop has become one of America’s most revered poets. And yet—painfully shy and living out of public—she has never been seen fully as a woman and artist. *Pulitzer Prize*-winner Megan Marshall makes use of newly discovered letters to reveal dimensions of the legendary author.

**Megan will appear in conversation with author Joan Wickersham *(The News from Spain*).**
