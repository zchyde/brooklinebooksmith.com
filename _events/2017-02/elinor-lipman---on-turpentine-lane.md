At thirty-two Faith returns to her hometown, and with the purchase of a sweet bungalow her life is finally on trackâ€¦kind of. But amidst the chaos a friendship blooms with Nick, her officemate par excellence. Poignant and a little outrageous, On Turpentine Lane is the screwball romantic comedy for our era.
