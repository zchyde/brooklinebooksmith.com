When darkness sweeps the Maresh Empire the fraught balance of magic blossoms into dangerous territory. The sequel to *A Gathering of Shadows* and the final book in the Shades of Magic series, *A Conjuring of Light* sees *New York Times*-bestselling author V. E. Schwab reach a thrilling conclusion.

Sometimes enemies are our only allies…In the second book of The Witchlands series, characters forge unlikely alliances in the fires of life and death. Caught between three empires with as many kinds of magic as ways to get in trouble, Susan Dennard’s protagonists do what they must to survive.
