How far will you go to achieve a dream? In ***You Will Know Me*** that's the question a celebrated coach poses to Katie and Eric Knox after he sees their daughter Devon, a gymnastics prodigy and Olympic hopeful, compete. For the Knoxes there are no limits–until a violent death rocks their close-knit gymnastics community and everything they have worked so hard for is suddenly at risk.

<br>When a hurricane slams into Boston, Detective Eddy Harkness is thrown into the eye of a very different kind of storm. Dark Horse — an especially pure and deadly brand of heroin — has infiltrated the gritty Lower South End. Fast-paced and atmospheric, ***Dark Horse*** moves from dive bars to Harvard dorm rooms to the city’s elite social clubs, as Harkness puts everything at risk to try to derail the seemingly unstoppable conspiracy before it’s too late.
