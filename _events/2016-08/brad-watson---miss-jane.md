Inspired by the true story of his own great-aunt, National Book Award-nominated author Brad Johnson explores the life of Miss Jane Chisolm, born in rural, early-twentieth-century Mississippi with a genital birth defect that would stand in the way of the central “uses” for a woman in that time and place—namely, sex and marriage. &nbsp;Free to satisfy only herself, she mesmerizes those around her, exerting an unearthly fascination that lives beyond her still.
