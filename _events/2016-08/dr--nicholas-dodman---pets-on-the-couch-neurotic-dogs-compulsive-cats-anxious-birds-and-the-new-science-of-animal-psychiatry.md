The Oliver Sacks of animal brains, Dr. Nicholas Dodman (*The Dog Who Loved Too Much*) once again breaks new ground with the practice of One Medicine, the profound recognition that humans and other animals share the same neurochemistry, and that our minds and emotions work in similar ways. Racehorses with Tourette’s, dogs with epilepsy, cats with OCD—these astonishing cases were all helped by One Medicine. Inspiring, sometimes heartbreaking, and utterly fascinating, Pets on the Couch demonstrates how what we share with our animals can only lead us to a greater appreciation for them—and our mutual bonds.
