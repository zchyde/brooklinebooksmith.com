*Tell Me the Number before Infinity* is an honest, moving, informative, often funny and inspiring account of a girl and her mother’s journey. Becky Taylor is a mathematical whiz, who has cerebral palsy and a B.S. in Computer Science. With her mother, Dena Taylor, M.S.W., they describe life in their family and the realities of having a disability. The Taylors’ pivotal action hugely contributed to California's historical mainstreaming of disabled children into the public school system.
