In language that is fresh, visceral, and deeply moving—and illustrations that are irreverent and gorgeous—artist and writer Molly Crabapple has written a memoir that will change the way you think about art, sex, politics, and survival in our times. From burlesque dancing to reporting on Guantanamo Bay and Syrian Rebels, Molly has used her words and artwork to shed light on the darker corners of American empire. Now, with the same blend of honesty, fierce insight, and indelible imagery that is her signature, Molly offers her own story: an unforgettable memoir of artistic exploration, political awakening, and personal transformation.
