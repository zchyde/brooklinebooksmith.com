Join us for influential artist Carson Ellis’s&nbsp;*Home*, a whimsical tribute to the many possibilities of home. Home might be a house in the country, an apartment in the city, or even a shoe. *Home* may be on the road or the sea, in the realm of myth, or in the artist’s own studio. A meditation on the concept of home and a visual treat that invites many return visits, this loving look at the places where people live marks the picture-book debut of Carson Ellis, acclaimed illustrator of the *Wildwood* series and artist for the indie band the Decemberists.
