Brothers Barry and Tommy Moser were born of the same parents in Tennessee, slept in the same bedroom, went to the same school, and were both poisoned by their familyâ€™s deep racism and anti-Semitism. But as they grew older, their perspectives and their paths grew further and further apart. Barry left Chattanooga for New England and a life in the arts; Tommy stayed put and became a mortgage banker. For nearly forty years, there was more strife between them than affection. When Barry was in his late fifties and Tommy was in his early sixties, their fragile relationship fell apart. We Were Brothers, written and illustrated by preeminent artist Barry Moser, is a powerful story of reunion told with candor and regret that captures the essence of sibling relationships.
