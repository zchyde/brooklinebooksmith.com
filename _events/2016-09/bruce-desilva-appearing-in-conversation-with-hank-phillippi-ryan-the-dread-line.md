Since he got fired from his newspaper job last year, former investigative reporter Liam Mulligan has been piecing together a new life for himself. The New England Patriots, shaken by murder charges against one of their players, have hired Mulligan to investigate the background of a college star they’re thinking of drafting. At first, the job seems routine, but when they begin asking questions, they get push-back. The player has something to hide—and someone is willing to kill to make sure it remains secret. Bruce will be appearing in conversation with mystery writer and investigative reporter Hank Phillippi Ryan (*What You See*).
