In Jensen Beachâ€™s extraordinarily poised collection of stories, characters are besieged and haunted by disasters both personal and national. Shot through with loss and the regret of missed opportunities,*Swallowed b**y the Cold* is a searching and crystalline book by a startlingly talented young writer.

Beginning with an aggravating phone call, a strange request, and the sudden disappearance of a mother and her daughter, *Unknown Caller* moves backwards in time and across several continents to tell a funny, moving, and genuinely surprising story about families, misunderstandings, secrets, falls from grace, and chances for redemption.
