An intimate psychological memoir, *The Future Tense of Joy* is the luminous account of one woman's efforts to free herself—and her family—from the demons of the past.&nbsp; The book deftly chronicles the daily consolations of marriage and motherhood, even as it exposes the treachery of silence to honor the healing power of love.
