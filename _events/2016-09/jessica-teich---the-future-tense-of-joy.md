Jessica fears she will never be free of her past—until she discovers the obituary of a young woman, whose life is a ghostly echo of her own. So begins Jessica Teich’s quest to unravel a mystery: the suicide of someone she never met. Part psychological memoir, part literary thriller, ***The Future Tense of Joy*** is the luminous account of one woman’s efforts to free herself, and her family, from the demons of the past.
