Credited with sparking the current memoir explosion, Mary Karr’s*The Liars’ Club* spent more than a year at the top of The New York Times bestseller list. In *The Art of Memoir*, she synthesizes her expertise as professor and therapy patient, writer and spiritual seeker, recovered alcoholic and “black belt sinner,” providing a unique window into the mechanics and art of the form that is as entertaining as her own work in the genre.
