All is quiet in the town of Paradise, except for a spate of innocuous vandalism. But when a major Boston crime boss is brutally murdered Jesse Stone suspects it’s the work of Mr. Peepers, a psychotic assassin who has caused trouble for Jesse in the past. Still, there’s a debt to pay and blood to be spilled to satisfy it. But whose blood, and just how much?
