Robert Quinlan is a seventy-year-old historian, teaching at Florida State University, where his wife Darla is also tenured. Their marriage, forged in the fervor of anti-Vietnam-war protests, now bears the fractures of time. From Pulitzer Prize-winner Robert Olen Butler comes *Perfume River*, an exquisite novel that examines family ties and the legacy of the Vietnam War through the portrait of a single family.
