With ***Standoff***, David Rivard, winner of the James Laughlin Award, asks an essential question: In a world of noise, of global anxiety and media distraction, how can we speak to each other with honesty?

Del Sol Poetry Prize-winner David Blairâ€™s ***Arsonville*** is a collection of &nbsp;poems in several registers at once, comic and elegiac, about contemporary life and its large intersections and personal interstices.
