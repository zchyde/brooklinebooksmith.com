This vivid novel follows characters whose fates intertwine in an iconic building in the East Village, the Christodora. Moving kaleidoscopically from the Tompkins Square Riots and attempts by activists to galvanize a true response to the AIDS epidemic, to the New York City of the future, Christodora recounts the heartbreak wrought by AIDS, illustrates the allure and destructive power of hard drugs, and brings to life the ever-changing city itself.**Tim Murphy will be appearing in conversation with novelist Scott Heim (*Mysterious Skin*).**
