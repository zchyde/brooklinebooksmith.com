A stunning debut from an author soon to join the ranks of Alan Furst and John le Carre. Washington D.C., 1953. The Cold War is heating up and the CIA is reeling from a double agent within their midst. Someone is selling secrets to the Soviets. Undercover agents have been assassinated, and anti-Communist plots are being cut short in ruthlessly efficient fashion. George Mueller seems like the perfect operative to help find the mole. He has secrets of his own though, and as he digs deeper into the case, suspicion begins to fall on him as well.&nbsp;

**Paul will be joined in conversation by Rob Wilstein, author and board member of Grub Street’s Novel Incubator Program.**
