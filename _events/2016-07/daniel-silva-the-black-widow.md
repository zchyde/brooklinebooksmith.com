Gabriel Allon, the art restorer, spy, and assassin, &nbsp;is poised to become the chief of Israelâ€™s secret intelligence service. But on the eve of his promotion, events conspire to lure him into the field for one final operation. ISIS has detonated a massive bomb in Paris, and a desperate French government wants Gabriel to eliminate the man responsible before he can strike again.
