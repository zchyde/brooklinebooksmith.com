\*\*A note from Chuck:&nbsp;

*The book signing events have been terrific, but they're stretching to 14+hours long.&nbsp; To save people's sanity, I will arrive three hours early and only do posed pictures with the first few hours of folks.&nbsp; Also, I can only sign and personalize FC2.&nbsp; Thank you for understanding.&nbsp;*

Thank you!
