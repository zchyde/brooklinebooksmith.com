*Sarong Party Girls* brilliantly captures the unique voice of a young, striving woman caught between worlds in the glitzy, moneyed city of Singapore. On the edge of twenty-seven, Jazzy hatches a plan for her and her best girlfriends. Before the year is out, these Sarong Party Girls will all have spectacular weddings to rich *ang moh*—Western expat—husbands. As she fervently pursues her quest to find a white husband, this bombastic yet tenderly vulnerable gold-digger reveals the contentious gender politics and class tensions thrumming beneath the shiny exterior of Singapore’s glamorous nightclubs and busy streets. **Cheryl will appear in conversation with National Book Award-winning novelist Julia Glass (Three Junes)**.
