Haunted by the memory of his sister’s death on 9/11, Kennedy, a private airport security contractor, knows more about airports than the head of the TSA. So when he’s kidnapped and recruited into a CIA ghost operation, he jumps at the opportunity to work with a team of some of the CIA's best counterterrorism analysts as they race against the clock to stop the greatest terrorist threat the United States will ever face.
