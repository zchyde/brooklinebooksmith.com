Nick Heller is a private spyâ€”an intelligence operative based in Boston, hired by lawyers, politicians, and even foreign governments. Called to Washington, DC, Nick has just forty-eight hours to disprove a rumor about the chief justice and an escort. But when the call girl is found murdered, the case takes a dangerous turn, and Nick resolves to find the mastermind behind the conspiracy before it claims any more victims.
