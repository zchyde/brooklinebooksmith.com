Internationally renowned photographer and Brookline resident Rania Matar joins us to share images from her latest collection, L'Enfant-Femme. In today’s world of endless photographing, tagging and posting images online, what is a pre-teen girl’s relationship to the camera? Photographing girls in the Middle East and the United States, Matar makes us examine our universality, a beauty that transcends place, background and religion. Candidly capturing her subjects at a critical juncture in the early stages of adolescence, Matar conveys the confluence of angst, sexuality and personhood that defines the progression from childhood into adulthood.
