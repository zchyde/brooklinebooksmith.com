When their adopted son Max suddenly turns feral, consorting with wild animals and eating grass, his Russian-American parents Maya and Alex embark on a cross-country trip to Montana to track down Max’s birth parents—the first drive west of New Jersey of their American lives. *Don’t Let My Baby Do Rodeo* is a novel about the mystery of inheritance and what exactly it means to belong.
