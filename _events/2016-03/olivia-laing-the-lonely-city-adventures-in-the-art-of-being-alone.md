When Olivia Laing (The Trip to Echo Spring) moved to New York City in her mid-thirties, she found herself inhabiting loneliness on a daily basis. Increasingly fascinated by this most shameful of experiences, she began to explore the lonely city by way of art. Moving fluidly between works and lives—from Edward Hopper’s Nighthawks to Andy Warhol’s Time Capsules—Laing conducts an electric, dazzling investigation into what it means to be alone.
