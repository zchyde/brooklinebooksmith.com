Appearing in conversation withÂ **Max Gladstone**

The trilogy that began with *The Emperor's Blades* and continued in *The Providence of Fire* reaches its epic conclusion. The ancient csestriim are back to finish their purge of humanity; armies march against the capital, and capricious gods walk the earth in human guise with agendas of their own. But the three imperial siblings at the heart of it all come to understand that even if they survive the holocaust unleashed on their world, there may be no reconciling their conflicting visions of the future. Brian will be appearing with acclaimed fantasy author Max Gladstone (*Three Parts Dead*).
