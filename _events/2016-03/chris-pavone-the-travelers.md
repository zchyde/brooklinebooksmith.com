**Appearing in conversation with Hank Phillippi Ryan**

Meet Will Rhodes: travel writer, recently married, barely solvent, his idealism rapidly giving way to disillusionment and the worry that he’s living the wrong life. Then one night, on assignment for the award-winning Travelers magazine in the wine region of Argentina, a beautiful woman makes him an offer he can’t refuse. Soon Will’s bad choices—and dark secrets—take him around the world &nbsp;in this pulse-racing international thriller from the New York Times bestselling author of The Expats and The Accident. Chris will be appearing with Hank Phillippi Ryan, the award-winning Boston author of the Jane Ryland mystery series.
