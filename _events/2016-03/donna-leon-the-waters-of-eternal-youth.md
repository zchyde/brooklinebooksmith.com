In Donna Leon’s Commissario Guido Brunetti series, the Venetian inspector has been called on to investigate many things, from shocking to petty crimes. But in *The Waters of Eternal Youth*, the 25th novel in this celebrated series, Brunetti finds himself drawn into a mysterious case that may not be a case at all. Awash in the rhythms and concerns of contemporary Venetian life, this haunting story of a woman trapped in a damaged perpetual childhood is another wonderful addition to the series.&nbsp;**This event will take place at the Coolidge Corner Theatre and requires tickets.**
