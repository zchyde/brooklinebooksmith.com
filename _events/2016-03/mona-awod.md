In her brilliant, hilarious, and at times shocking debut, Mona Awad simultaneously skewers the body image-obsessed culture that tells women they have no value outside their physical appearance, and delivers a tender and moving depiction of a lovably difficult young woman whose life is hijacked by her struggle to conform. Called “[A] beautiful, necessary book ” by Roxanne Gay,*13 Ways of Looking at a Fat Girl* introduces a vital new voice in fiction.
