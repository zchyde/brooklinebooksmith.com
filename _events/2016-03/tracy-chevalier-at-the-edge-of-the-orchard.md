From internationally bestselling author Tracy Chevalier (Girl with a Pearl Earring), comes a riveting drama of a pioneer family on the American frontier. 1838: James and Sadie Goodenough and their five children work relentlessly to tame their patch of land, buying saplings from a local tree man known as John Appleseed. 1853: Their youngest child Robert is haunted, wandering through Gold Rush California. In the redwood and giant sequoia groves he finds some solace, collecting seeds for a naturalist. &nbsp;But you can run only so far, even in America, and when Robertâ€™s past makes an unexpected appearance he must decide whether to strike out again or stake his own claim to a home at last.
