Roger Rosenblatt, the award-winning essayist and *New York Times*bestselling author of *Making Toast*, returns to fiction with this reflective, bittersweet tale that introduces the irrepressible aging poet Thomas Murphy. An Irishman, a dreamer, a poet, Murph, like Whitman, sings lustily of himself and of everyone. Through his often-extravagant behavior and observations, both hilarious and profound, we see the world in all its strange glory, equally beautiful and ridiculous. Behold the charming, wistful, vibrant, aging Thomas Murphy, whose story celebrates the ageless confusion that is this dreadful, gorgeous life.
