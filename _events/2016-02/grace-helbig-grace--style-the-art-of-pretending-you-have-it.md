From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of *Grace’s Guide* and the host of The Grace Helbig Show on E! comes a beautifully illustrated, tongue-in-cheek book about style that lampoons fashion and beauty guides while offering practical advice in Grace Helbig’s trademark sweet and irreverent voice.

This is a signing-only event.

**Purchase of Grace & Style from Brookline Booksmith is required to attend.**
