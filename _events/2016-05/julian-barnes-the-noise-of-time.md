In his first novel since the Man Booker Prize–winning The Sense of an Ending, Julian Barnes elegantly guides us through the trajectory Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich’s career, at the same time illuminating the tumultuous evolution of the Soviet Union. The result is both a stunning portrait of a relentlessly fascinating man and a brilliant exploration of the meaning of art and its place in society. **This event will take place at the Coolidge Corner Theatre and will require tickets.
