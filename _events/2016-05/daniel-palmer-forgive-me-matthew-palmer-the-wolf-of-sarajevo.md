In *Forgive Me*, P.I. Angie DeRose makes a life-altering discovery in the wake of her mother's sudden death. Hidden in her parents' attic is a photograph of a little girl, with a code and a handwritten message on the back: "May God forgive me."

*The Wolf of Sarajevo* is a riveting novel of international suspense from veteran diplomat Matthew Palmer set against a scarred Sarajevo with the specter of war once again hanging over the Balkans.
