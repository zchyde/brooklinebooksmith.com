Diane Guerrero, the television actress from the megahit *Orange is the New Black* and *Jane the Virgin*, was just fourteen years old on the day her parents were detained and deported. Born in the U.S., Guerrero was able to remain in the country and continue her education without the support system of her family.*In the Country We Love* is a moving, heartbreaking story of one woman's extraordinary resilience in the face of the nightmarish struggles of undocumented residents in this country.
