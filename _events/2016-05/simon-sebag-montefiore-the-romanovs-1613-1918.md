To rule Russia was both imperial-sacred mission and poisoned chalice: six of the last twelve tsars were murdered. The Romanovs were the most successful dynasty of modern times, ruling a sixth of the world’s surface for three centuries. Simon Sebag Montefiore’s gripping chronicle reveals their secret world of unlimited power and ruthless empire-building, overshadowed by palace conspiracy, family rivalries, sexual decadence and wild extravagance.
