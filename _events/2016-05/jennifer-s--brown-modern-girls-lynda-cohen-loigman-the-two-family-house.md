*Modern Girls* is a dazzling debut novel set in New York City’s Jewish immigrant community in 1935. Dottie Krasinsky, a bookkeeper in Midtown Manhattan, is the epitome of the modern girl. Yet at heart, she is a dutiful daughter, living with her Yiddish-speaking parents on the Lower East Side. So when, after a single careless night, she finds herself in a family way by a charismatic but unsuitable man, she is desperate: unwed, unsure, and running out of options.

Lynda Cohen Loigman's debut novel *The Two-Family House* is a heart-wrenching, gripping multigenerational story, woven around the deepest of secrets. Brooklyn, 1947: In the midst of a blizzard, in a two-family brownstone, two babies are born, minutes apart. Raising their families side by side, supporting one another, Rose and Helen, sisters by marriage, share an impenetrable bond forged before and during that dramatic winter night.
