The fire raged hot and fast, lighting up Boston’s South End and killing three firefighters. A year later, as the city prepares to honor their sacrifice, there are still no answers about how the deadly fire started. This latest installment in Robert B. Parker’s beloved Spenser series sees the detective following the trail of fires to Boston’s underworld, bringing him, and his trusted ally Hawk, toe-to-toe with a dangerous new enemy who wants Spenser dead, and doesn’t play by the city’s old rules.
