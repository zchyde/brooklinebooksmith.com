From one of the most interesting and iconic musicians of our time, a piercingly tender, funny, and harrowing account of the path from suburban poverty and alienation to a life of beauty, squalor and unlikely success out of the NYC club scene of the late '80s and '90s. Mobyâ€™s voice resonates with honesty, wit, and, above all, an unshakable passion for his music that steered him through some very rough seas.
