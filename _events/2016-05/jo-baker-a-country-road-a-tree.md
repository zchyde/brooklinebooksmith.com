Paris, 1939. The pavement rumbles with the footfall of Nazi soldiers marching along the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es. A young, unknown writer—Samuel Beckett—recently arrived from Ireland to make his mark, smokes one last cigarette with his lover before the city they know is torn apart. Soon he will put them both in mortal danger by joining the Resistance. From the best-selling author of *Longbourn* comes a haunting new novel of spies and artists, passion and danger, hope in the face of despair
