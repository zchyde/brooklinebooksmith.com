Bakerton, a depressed mining town, has been granted a surprise third act: it sits squarely atop a massive deposit of natural gas. To drill or not to drill?Told through a cast of characters whose lives are increasingly bound by the opposing interests that underpin the national debate, *Heat and Light* depicts a community blessed and cursed by its natural resources. This is a dispatch from a forgotten America—a work of searing moral clarity from one of the finest writers of her generation, a courageous and necessary book.
