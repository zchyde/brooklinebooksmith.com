Over eleven years Mark Greif, co-founder of*n+1* magazine, wrote essays exploring the tyranny of exercise; ; the sexualization of childhood; the philosophy of Radiohead; the rise and fall of hipsters; the impact of the Occupy movement; and the crisis of policing. Each one is entertaining, and, from start to finish, dead serious.
