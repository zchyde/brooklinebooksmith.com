Ash McKenna used to be an amateur P.I.—emphasis on “amateur”. But after a traumatic turn of events, ***South Village*** finds him living on a commune in the Georgia woods, binge-drinking cheap whiskey and waiting for his passport to flee the country. Then a man is found dead. It’s written off as an accident, but Ash suspects something more sinister. As he struggles to understand the violence, while keeping his own demons at bay, Ash finds that it’s only a matter of time before one or the other puts him down for good.

***Rough Trade***, the long-awaited second novel in the Boston-based Anthony Award-nominated Boo and Junior series finds Junior called in for questioning for a murder he didn’t commit. Boo is determined to find the real killer, even if he has to face down crooked cops, crazed guard dogs, the Irish mob and—worst of all—his own ingrained prejudices. Action-packed, outrageously funny, and brutally honest, Rough Trade brings back crime fiction’s favorite bouncers in a novel that’s whip-smart, gritty, and above all human.
