Two stellar childrenâ€™s authors share their magical, spooky new novels just in time for Halloween.&nbsp;

***Brightwood:*** Daisy has never left her home of Brightwood Hall, a labyrinth filled with animals and talking portraits. But her mother vanishes, and Daisy finds herself besieged by a menacing stranger who wants Brightwood for himself.

***The Marvelous Magic of Miss Mable***: Mabel is happy at magical Ruthersfield Academy, even if she gets in trouble for her experimental potions. When an assignment reveals that she was found as a baby in a flowerpot, Mabel no longer knows what to think. Who is she, why she was left in the flowerpot, and where is her birth family?
