From the National Book Award–winning author of*Just Kids, M Train* is an unforgettable odyssey of a legendary artist, told through the caf&eacute;s and haunts she has worked in around the world. It is a book Patti Smith has described as “a roadmap to my life.” Braiding despair with hope and consolation, illustrated with her signature Polaroids,*M Train* is a meditation on travel, detective shows, literature, and coffee. It is a powerful, deeply moving book by one of the most remarkable multiplatform artists at work today.**Patti Smith will be appearing in conversation with author and Boston native Michael Patrick MacDonald (*All Souls*).**
