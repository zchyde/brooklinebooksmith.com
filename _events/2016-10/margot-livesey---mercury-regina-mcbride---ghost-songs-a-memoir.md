In ***Mercury*** Donald believes he knows all there is to know about seeing. An optometrist in suburban Boston, he is sure that he and his wife, Viv, who runs the local stables, are both devoted to their two children and to each other. Then Mercury—a gorgeous young thoroughbred with a murky past—arrives and as Viv rides him she begins to dream of competing again. Her daydreams soon morph into consuming desire, and her infatuation with the thoroughbred escalates to obsession.

Eighteen-year-old Regina McBride is haunted by the ghosts of her parents. Raised Irish Catholic and with the ironclad belief that some sins are unforgivable, Regina fears her parents are trapped between worlds, forever punished after they committed suicide within a few months of each other. Lyrical and lovely, harrowing and haunting, ***Ghost Songs*** charts her struggle to separate madness from imagination and sorrow from devastation.
