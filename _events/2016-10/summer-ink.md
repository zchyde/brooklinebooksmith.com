Summer Ink is a Boston-based writing and adventure camp for 5th-10th graders. With fifty percent of campers receiving scholarships, Summer Ink's diverse population forms a rich community of writers hailing from Boston, the suburbs, and beyond. Â Campers come away from their Summer Ink experience with the skills to communicate their ideas clearly and the conviction that the world wants to hear them.
