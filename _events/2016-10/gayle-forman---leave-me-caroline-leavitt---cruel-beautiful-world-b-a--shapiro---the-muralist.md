With bighearted characters--husbands, wives, friends, and lovers--who stumble and trip, grow and forgive, ***Leave Me*** is about facing the fears we’re all running from. Gayle Forman is a dazzling observer of human nature. She has written an irresistible novel that confronts the ambivalence of modern motherhood head on and asks, what happens when a grown woman runs away from home?

Caroline Leavitt is at her mesmerizing best in ***Cruel Beautiful World*** a haunting, nuanced portrait of love, sisters, and the impossible legacy of family. It’s 1969, and sixteen-year-old Lucy is about to run away to live off the grid in rural Pennsylvania, a rash act that will have vicious repercussions for both her and her older sister, Charlotte. As Lucy’s default caretaker for most of their lives, Charlotte’s youth has been marked by the burden of responsibility, but never more so than when Lucy’s dream of a rural paradise turns into a nightmare.

From the author of the *New York Times* bestseller *The Art Forger* comes a thrilling new novel that traces the life and mysterious disappearance of a brilliant young artist on the eve of World War II. Entwining the lives of both historical and fictional characters, and moving between the past and the present, ***The Muralist*** plunges readers into the divisiveness of prewar politics and the largely forgotten plight of European refugees refused entrance to the United States.
