In Taiwan, the Mid-Autumn Festival is a time for prioritizing family. When 25-year-old Jing-nan’s gangster uncle, Big Eye, asks a favor, Jing-nan can’t exactly say no. Big Eye’s teen daughter, Mei-ling, has a biker boyfriend from the wrong side of the tracks—in Big Eye’s gangster opinion—and Big Eye wants Jing-nan to bring her to Taipei, away from the bad influences. But Mei-ling is hiding a secret—one that puts her in harm’s way, and if Jing-nan wants to save his cousin from her own demons, he has to figure out the truth, even if it tears his family apart—again.
