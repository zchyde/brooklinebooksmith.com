<br>Alexey Pajitnov had big ideas about games. In 1984, he created Tetris in his spare time while developing software for the Soviet government. Once Tetris emerged from behind the Iron Curtain, it was an instant hit. A bidding war was sparked, followed by clandestine trips to Moscow, backroom deals, innumerable miscommunications, and outright theft. For the first time and in unparalleled detail, Tetris: The Games People Play tells the true story of the worldâ€™s most popular video game. Box Brown will appear in conversation with Liz Prince (Tomboy: A Graphic Memoir).
