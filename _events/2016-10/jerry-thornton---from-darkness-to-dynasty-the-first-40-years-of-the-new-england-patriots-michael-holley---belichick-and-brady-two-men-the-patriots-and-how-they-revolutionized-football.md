From Darkness to Dynasty reveals the unlikely history of the New England Patriots. From their humble beginnings as a team bought with rainy day money by a man who had no idea what he was doing, to their fateful first Super Bowl victory, Jerry Thornton shares the wild, humiliating, unbelievable, and wonderful stories that comprised the first 40 years of the most dominant franchise in NFL history.

Featuring interviews from Patriots players and coaches, in Belichick and Brady Michael Holley presents a fascinating portrait of the partnership between Tom Brady, the Patriots' star quarterback, and Bill Belichick, the team's prolific coach. Chockful of behind-the-scenes anecdotes and information exploring how they have strategized and weathered controversies, all culminating into four Superbowl rings, this is required reading for any Patriots fan and students of the game of football.
