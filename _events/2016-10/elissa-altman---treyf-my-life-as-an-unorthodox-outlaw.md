From Elissa Altman, the *Washington Post*columnist and James Beard Award-winning author of Poor Man’s Feast comes a story of seeking truth, acceptance, and self in a world of contradiction. Every part of Elissa Altman’s Queens, New York, childhood was laced with contradiction: synagogue on Saturday and Chinese pork ribs on Sunday; bat mitzvahs followed by shrimp-in-lobster-sauce luncheons; her old-country grandparents, whose kindness and love were tied to unspoken rage, and her bell-bottomed neighbors, whose adoring affection hid dark secrets. Spanning from 1940s wartime Brooklyn to 1970s Queens to present-day rural New England, Treyf is a vivid tale of what it means to come to yourself both in spite and in honor to your past.
