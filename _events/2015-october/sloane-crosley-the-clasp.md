A group of reunited twentysomething friends are launched on a madcap international quest for a missing necklace in the debut novel of New York Times bestselling essayist Sloane Crosley (I Was Told There’d Be Cake). Told with Sloane’s inimitable spark and wit; it is a story of obsession and the pitfalls of modern relationships, of friends struggling to fit together now that their lives haven’t gone as planned, and of how to separate the real from the fake.
