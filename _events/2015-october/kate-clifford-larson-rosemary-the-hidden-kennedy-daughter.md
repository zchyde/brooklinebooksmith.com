Summary: Joe and Rose Kennedy’s beautiful daughter Rosemary attended exclusive schools, and traveled the world, and yet, Rosemary was intellectually disabled — a secret fiercely guarded by her family. Kate Larson reveals both the sensitive care Rosemary received and the often desperate and duplicitous arrangements the Kennedys made to keep her away from home, culminating in Joe’s decision to have Rosemary lobotomized at age twenty-three.
