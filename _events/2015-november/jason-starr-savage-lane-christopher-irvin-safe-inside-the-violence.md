Jason Starr’s **Savage Lane** is his most riveting and intimate novel yet, a dark, domestic thriller and an honest, searing satire of a declining marriage, suburban life, and obsessive love.

Christopher Irvin’s **Safe Inside the Violence** is an unforgettable collection of 13 crime stories described by LitReactor as “lightning fast, hard hitting, [it] leaves the reader breathless and shocked with the sudden and realistic portrayal of violence."
