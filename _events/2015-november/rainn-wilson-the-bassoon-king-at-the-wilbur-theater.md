Rainn Wilson is best known for his Emmy-nominated role as Dwight Schrute on NBC’s *The Office*, though today he’s equally well-known for his millions of Twitter followers and the philosophy website he founded, SoulPancake, which launched a <i>New York Times</i>bestselling book of the same name. Now, in *The Bassoon King* he’s ready to tell his own story and explain how he came up with his incredibly unique sense of humor and perspective on life.
