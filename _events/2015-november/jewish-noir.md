Jewish Noir is a unique collection of crime stories exploring such issues as the Holocaust and its long-term effects on subsequent generations, anti-Semitism, and the dark side of the Diaspora. Editor Kenneth Wishnia (23 Shades of Black) will be joined by contributors Heywood Gould (Fort Apache the Bronx), Steven Wishnia (When the Drumming Stops), and Bostonâ€™s own Dave Zeltserman (The Boy Who Killed Demons).
