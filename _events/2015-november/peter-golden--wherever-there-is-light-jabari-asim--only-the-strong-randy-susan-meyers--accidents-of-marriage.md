Join us for a night of fiction as three novelists present their latest works and discuss how social issues arise in literature. Peter Goldenâ€™s Wherever There is Light chronicles the decades-long love affair between a Jewish immigrant and the granddaughter of a slave. In Only the Strong Jabari Asim skillfully renders a compelling portrait of 1970s urban life in the wake of the last major civil-rights bill. Randy Susan Meyers explores emotional abuse, traumatic injury, and children lost in the shuffle in Accidents of Marriage.
