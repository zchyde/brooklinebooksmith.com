[The Lonely City: Adventures in the Art of Being Alone](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781250039576) by Olivia Laing

Olivia Laing's deep and enlightening work explores the significance of loneliness in cities, in art, and in our experience of reality.

Laing includes deft investigations of artists like Edward Hopper ([Nighthawks](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Nighthawks_by_Edward_Hopper_1942.jpg/1280px-Nighthawks_by_Edward_Hopper_1942.jpg)) whose loneliness defined their work.

These biographies, alongside her own provocative memoir, create a sense of companionship in the empty, negative space of loneliness.
