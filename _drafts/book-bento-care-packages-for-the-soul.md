[The Lonely City](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781250039576) by Olivia Laing
&nbsp;

Olivia Laing's deep and enlightening work The Lonely City explores the significance of loneliness in urban life, art, and our experience of reality.&nbsp;

Laing includes deft investigations of artists like Edward Hopper (Nighthawks) whose loneliness defined their work.&nbsp;

These biographies, alongside her own provocative memoir, create a sense of companionship in the empty, negative space of loneliness.
