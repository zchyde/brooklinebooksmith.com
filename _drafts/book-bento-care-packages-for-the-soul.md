[The Lonely City](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781250039576) by Olivia Laing &nbsp;

Olivia Laing's deep and enlightening work The Lonely City explores the significance of loneliness in cities, in art, and in our experience of reality.&nbsp;

Laing includes deft investigations of artists like Edward Hopper ([Nighthawks](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Nighthawks_by_Edward_Hopper_1942.jpg/1280px-Nighthawks_by_Edward_Hopper_1942.jpg)) whose loneliness defined their work.&nbsp;

These biographies, alongside her own provocative memoir, create a sense of companionship in the empty, negative space of loneliness. &nbsp;
