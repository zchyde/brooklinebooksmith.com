As I mentioned to you all[a year ago](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/kidsmith/2015/08/31/the-fall-is-falling/), fall is a difficult season for booksellers. The best weather of the year is here, beverage choices are vastly, positively expanded from summer, and like ninety percent of the books we've been waiting for since February hit the shelves on a single Tuesday morning, and the whole bookselling community perishes at once, smothered beneath cardboard displays stuffed with our literary hopes and dreams.

ROUGH TIMES.

[ADA TWIST, SCIENTIST](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781419721373) (Andrea Beaty and David Roberts) is pictured in large quantities in the cardboard ediface to the rear.*

Let me explain to you how fall works in the kids' section. You take all the summer reading books down of their summer reading display and put up one million books about Halloween as the summer reading is squashed them back into your normal overstock.&nbsp; You bring in ten thousand million copies of every book you've ever seen in your life, because as soon as they exit the beach, forward-thinking people *begin contemplating their holiday shopping*.

And then every new, exciting, important book in the world arrives in the store on that one fateful day. Let's call it this Tuesday. Sometimes, walking through the kids' section, you (non-bookseller, normal shopper you) may notice cardboard displays like the one pictured above. Sometimes we have up to three of these sitting out in the section! Holding important and beautiful new books!!

In the fall these burst from the ground like the green growing things of a newborn Narnia. First there are two, and then four, and then several counter-top displays for a counter you are not sure if you have, and then there are whole squadrons of these four-foot lumbering beasts wearing flashy hats, full of lively hardcovers that leap out at you like angry seagulls every time you set one up. They are soon lining up against the bookshelves, leaning ominously as you attempt to bolster them with packing tape. You run out of corners where you can stand things. You wonder if this will be the end.

You drink some coffee, get up on your ladder, and push the overstock around until everything fits and you're relatively balanced again, feelings-wise, and ready to face the vast army of standing displays once again.
