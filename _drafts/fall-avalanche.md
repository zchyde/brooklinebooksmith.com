As I mentioned to you all[a year ago](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/kidsmith/2015/08/31/the-fall-is-falling/), Fall is a difficult season for booksellers. The best weather of the year is here, beverage choices are vastly, positively expanded, and like ninety percent of the books we've been waiting for hit the shelves on a single Tuesday and we perish, smothered beneath cardboard dumps filled with kid-literary perfection.

ROUGH.
