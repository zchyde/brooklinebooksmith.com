As I mentioned to you all[a year ago](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/kidsmith/2015/08/31/the-fall-is-falling/), fall is a difficult season for booksellers. The best weather of the year is here, beverage choices are vastly, positively expanded from summer, and like ninety percent of the books we've been waiting for since February hit the shelves on a single Tuesday morning, and the whole bookselling community perishes at once, smothered beneath cardboard displays stuffed with our literary hopes and dreams.

ROUGH TIMES.

[ADA TWIST, SCIENTIST](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781419721373) (Andrea Beaty and David Roberts) is pictured in large quantities in a cardboard ediface to the rear.*

Let me explain to you how fall works in the kids' section. You take down all the summer reading books and squash them back into your normal overstock. You start bringing in more copies of things because, as soon as they exit the beach, forward-thinking people *begin contemplating their holiday shopping*. And then every new book in the world that is BIG AND IMPORTANT AND FAMOUS arrives at once. Sometimes, walking through the kids' section, you (non-bookseller, normal shopper you) may notice cardboard displays like the one pictured above. Sometimes we have up to three of these sitting out in the section! Holding important and beautiful new books!! Yesterday we had ten.
<br>
<br>So you add ten thousand million new copies of every book on the planet, saving up for the moment when people will start coming in and buying them, ALL of them, and you know the days will come when the shelves look desolate, but for now you just have ALL THE BOOKS IN THE KNOWN WORLD AND YOU REALLY REALLY LOVE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM AND IT HURTS, EMOTIONALLY, BECAUSE YOU LIKE THEM SO MUCH.
<br>
<br>Then you drink some coffee, get up on your ladder, and push the overstock around until everything fits and you're relatively balanced again, feelings-wise.
