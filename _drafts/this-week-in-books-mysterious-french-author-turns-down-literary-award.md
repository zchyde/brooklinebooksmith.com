The acad&eacute;mie Goncourt surprised the literary public this week by awarding the prestigious Prix Goncourt du Premier Roman (Goncourt prize for best and most imaginative debut novel of the year) to a book that was not on the public shortlist, "De nos fr&egrave;res bless&eacute;s" ("From Our Wounded Brothers") by Joseph Andras. Andras made bigger headlines, however, by refusing to accept the prize or its â‚¬3,800 award. From [bibliOBS](http://bibliobs.nouvelobs.com/actualites/20160513.OBS0432/joseph-andras-refuse-le-prix-goncourt-du-premier-roman.html) (auto-translated from the French):

The information was communicated to&nbsp;[20minutes.fr](http://www.20minutes.fr/culture/1842167-20160509-surprise-goncourt-premier-roman-liste)&nbsp;by his press attache at Actes Sud: "I confirm that the author does not accept the prize. He of course thanked the members of the jury who have liked his book, but cannot accept the award because his conception of literature is not compatible with the idea of a competition."&nbsp;
