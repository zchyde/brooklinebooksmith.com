Have you heard about NOAA’s advances in predicting the weather, informing the public about severe weather events, and their newer climate change data?&nbsp; Recently, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has made some major upgrades to their weather predicting programs.&nbsp; In March (2016), NOAA revealed how its 2 new supercomputers (one in Florida and one in Virginia) are significantly upgrading the quality of our weather predicting capabilities.&nbsp; In May (2016) NOAA transferred to 4-D ensemble hybrid data assimilation, which “takes into account how weather systems evolve on a 3-D spatial grid over time, with time now becoming the fourth dimension.&nbsp; &nbsp;NOAA’s powerful new supercomputers paved the way for another upgrade to the U.S. Global Forecast System (GFS), NOAA’s primary model for weather prediction” ([NOAA](http://www.noaa.gov/noaa%E2%80%99s-premier-forecast-model-goes-four-dimensional)). The current &nbsp;GFS model operates about 4 times each day and predicts weather 16 days ahead.&nbsp; The new GFS model will distribute hourly forecast guidance out to five days, not just every three hours as it does now.&nbsp; NOAA’s weather and climate models are free and available to the public: [http://www.noaa.gov/](http://www.noaa.gov/)&nbsp;
