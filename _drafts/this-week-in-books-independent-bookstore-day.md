Did you know this Saturday, April 30th is the second annual [Independent Bookstore Day](http://www.indiebookstoreday.com/)? Over 400 bookstores around the country are gearing up with special activities and exclusive items to celebrate the tradition of locally-run bookslingers, still going strong in the digital age.

We're giving away three deluxe book & gift arrangements, and every ticket increases your chances of winning! Short on dough at the end of the month? We still want to see your lovely faces - you can get a ticket by dropping by and snapping a selfie in your favorite part of the store.
