One of my favorite young adult reads in recent months has been Corinne Duyvis's&nbsp;*On the Edge of Gone*. This sci-fi disaster story embraces the classic&nbsp;*Armageddon*-style world-choking, dino-killing impact to end all impacts. Unlike the meteor in*&nbsp;Armageddon*, the comet in this book hits, and it hits hard. Earth's atmosphere is clogged, the world's technological and material infrastructures are decimated, food is scarce and natural disasters are kicked into high gear. Most of the action involves Amsterdam teenager Denise trying achieve the impossible and get herself, her missing sister, and their drug-dependent mother passage on a private generation ship before it leaves Earth for good.

In short, Denise is swimming against the current, except that in this case the current is a giant tsunami rearing up to crush your entire city. But as tense as the plot is, and as horrifying the flooded, darkened landscape may be, one of the most compelling things about this book is its narrator. Denise's difficulty in securing passage isn't limited to her mother's addiction or her trans sister's gender identity. Denise is also autistic, and on a ship where everyone is selected for utility, it's reasonable to be terrified that her behaviors and needs will be viewed as not worth saving.

The book is a gratifying blend of not-yet-in-space opera and disaster movie, page-turning and cinematic. It's a great combination of sometimes improbable but heroic plot mixed with real human problems on the down and dirty personal level. But its real strength is in which humans and which problems get talked about. Duyvis's characters are an answer to a common and frustrated question from science fiction readers:&nbsp;*where are all the disabled people in the apocalypse?&nbsp;*In most post-apocalyptic literature, they die first--or simply cease to exist.

They're not gone here. They're not all earmarked as victims. They're just on the edge with everyone else. And they have a voice.
