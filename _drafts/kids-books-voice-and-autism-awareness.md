One of my favorite young adult reads in recent months has been Corinne Duyvis's&nbsp;*On the Edge of Gone*. This sci-fi disaster story embraces the classic&nbsp;*Armageddon*-style world-choking, dino-killing impact to end all impacts. Unlike the meteor in*&nbsp;Armageddon*, the comet in this book hits, and it hits hard. Earth's atmosphere is clogged, the world's technological and material infrastructures are decimated, food is scarce and natural disasters are kicked into high gear. Most of the action involves Amsterdam teenager Denise trying to upend all probability to get her missing sister and drug-dependent mother passage on a private generation ship before it leaves Earth for good.

It's a nerve-wracking tale of pushing against the current when the current is the entire ocean rearing up to crush your city beneath it. As tense as the plot is, and as horrifying the flooded, darkened landscape, one of the most compelling things about this book is its narrator. Denise's difficulty in securing passage isn't limited to her mother's addiction or her transgender sister's gender identity. She's also autistic, and on a ship where everyone is selected for utility, it's reasonable to be terrified that her behaviors and needs will be viewed as not worth saving.
