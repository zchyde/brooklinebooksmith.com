One of my favorite young adult reads in recent months has been Corinne Duyvis's&nbsp;*On the Edge of Gone*. This sci-fi disaster story embraces the classic&nbsp;*Armageddon*-style world-choking, dino-killing impact to end all impacts. Unlike the meteor in*&nbsp;Armageddon*, the comet in this book hits, and it hits hard. Earth's atmosphere is clogged, the world's technological and material infrastructures are decimated, food is scarce and natural disasters are kicked into high gear. Most of the action involves Amsterdam teenager Denise trying achieve the impossible and get herself, her missing sister, and their drug-dependent mother passage on a private generation ship before it leaves Earth for good.

In short, Denise is swimming against the current, except that in this case the current is a giant tsunami rearing up to crush your entire city. But as tense as the plot is, and as horrifying the flooded, darkened landscape may be, one of the most compelling things about this book is its narrator. Denise's difficulty in securing passage isn't limited to her mother's addiction or her trans sister's gender identity. Denise is also autistic,\* and on a ship where everyone is selected for utility, it's reasonable to be terrified that her behaviors and needs will be viewed as not worth saving.&nbsp;

The book is a gratifying blend of not-yet-in-space opera and disaster movie, page-turning and cinematic. It's a great combination of sometimes improbable but heroic plot mixed with real human problems on the down and dirty personal level. But its real strength is in which humans and which problems get talked about. Duyvis's characters are a purposeful answer to a common frustration for science fiction readers:&nbsp;*where are all the disabled people in the apocalypse?&nbsp;*In most post-apocalyptic literature, they die first--or simply cease to exist. You certainly don't see a lot of biracial teenage autistic girls

They're not gone here. They're not all earmarked as victims. They're just on the edge with everyone else. And they have a voice.

Denise is a particularly strong character because her author, like herself, is autistic. &nbsp;There aren't a lot of books out there with autistic main characters--especially not written by authors who can write from personal experience.&nbsp;

Sometimes a book features&nbsp;

April is Autism Awareness Month. For those of you who, like me, are *not*on the autistic spectrum, I suggest building awareness through reading books by people who *are*. This is a conversation where many, many voices speak constantly and at high volume. The most valuable voices are the people whom the conversation&nbsp;

<br>\*Many people have a strong preference between the terms&nbsp;*autistic*or *person with autism.*&nbsp;I'm sticking with the former here based on the language of the book and how Corinne Duyvis has described her own feelings regarding terminology.
