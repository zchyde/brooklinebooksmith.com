Whether it's been pouring rain, pelting ice, blinding snow, or burning cold, this February has been a month to stay indoors. You could use the time you're trapped inside to feverishly organize everything you own, or you could stare into the forgiving face of Netflix for ten hours at a time. (There are ten seasons of *Friends*. There are seven seasons of *Gilmore Girls*. There are a *number*of infinitely re-watchable David Attenborough nature specials).
