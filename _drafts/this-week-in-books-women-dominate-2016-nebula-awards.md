Women writers came close\*\* to sweeping the Nebula Awards for outstanding sci-fi/fantasy writing published in 2015, which were presented this weekend. The Nebulas, which are awarded by the Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America (the holdouts were George Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris took home the Ray Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation for their acclaimed screenplay Mad Max: Fury Road, [widely](http://nypost.com/2015/05/14/why-mad-max-fury-road-is-the-feminist-picture-of-the-year/) [hailed](http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/20/8620229/mad-max-fury-road-anti-feminist-mens-rights-boycott) [as](http://www.hitfix.com/harpy/7-ways-mad-max-fury-road-sublimely-subverts-movie-sexism) [a](https://www.buzzfeed.com/lauriepenny/the-fast-and-the-feminist?utm_term=.jezMv76Gm#.iiok92zm4) [feminist](http://www.themarysue.com/george-miller-feminist-answer-franchise/) [magnum](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/27/sexists-are-scared-of-mad-max-because-it-is-a-call-to-dismantle-patriarchies) [opus](http://www.gender-focus.com/2015/05/26/who-killed-the-world-the-complicated-feminism-of-mad-max-fury-road/).) The winners pool stands in stark contrast to the shortlist for this year's Hugos: the sci-fi/fantasy award's ballot system was hijacked for the second year running by right-wing factions who protest the rising prominence of women, queer writers and writers of color within the genre.

Novel: *[Uprooted](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780804179058)*by Naomi Novik

Agnieszka loves her valley home, her quiet village, the forests and the bright shining river. But the corrupted Wood stands on the border, full of malevolent power, and its shadow lies over her life. Her people rely on the cold, driven wizard known only as the Dragon to keep its powers at bay. But he demands a terrible price for his help: one young woman handed over to serve him for ten years, a fate almost as terrible as falling to the Wood.
<br>The next choosing is fast approaching, and Agnieszka is afraid. She knows "everyone" knows that the Dragon will take Kasia: beautiful, graceful, brave Kasia, all the things Agnieszka isn t, and her dearest friend in the world. And there is no way to save her. But Agnieszka fears the wrong things. For when the Dragon comes, it is not Kasia he will choose.
