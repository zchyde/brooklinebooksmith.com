Women writers came close\*\* to sweeping the Nebula Awards for outstanding sci-fi/fantasy writing published in 2015, which were presented this weekend. The Nebulas, which are awarded by the Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America (the holdouts were George Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris took home the Ray Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation for their acclaimed screenplay Mad Max: Fury Road, [widely](http://nypost.com/2015/05/14/why-mad-max-fury-road-is-the-feminist-picture-of-the-year/) [hailed](http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/20/8620229/mad-max-fury-road-anti-feminist-mens-rights-boycott) [as](http://www.hitfix.com/harpy/7-ways-mad-max-fury-road-sublimely-subverts-movie-sexism) [a](https://www.buzzfeed.com/lauriepenny/the-fast-and-the-feminist?utm_term=.jezMv76Gm#.iiok92zm4) [feminist](http://www.themarysue.com/george-miller-feminist-answer-franchise/) [magnum](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/27/sexists-are-scared-of-mad-max-because-it-is-a-call-to-dismantle-patriarchies) [opus](http://www.gender-focus.com/2015/05/26/who-killed-the-world-the-complicated-feminism-of-mad-max-fury-road/).) The winners pool stands in stark contrast to the shortlist for this year's Hugos: the sci-fi/fantasy award's ballot system was hijacked for the second year running by right-wing factions who protest the rising prominence of women, queer writers and writers of color within the genre.

Novel: *[Uprooted](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780804179058)*by Naomi Novik

Agnieszka loves her valley home, her quiet village, the forests and the bright shining river. But the corrupted Wood stands on the border, full of malevolent power, and its shadow lies over her life. Her people rely on the cold, driven wizard known only as the Dragon to keep its powers at bay. But he demands a terrible price for his help: one young woman handed over to serve him for ten years, a fate almost as terrible as falling to the Wood.

The next choosing is fast approaching, and Agnieszka is afraid. She knows "everyone" knows that the Dragon will take Kasia: beautiful, graceful, brave Kasia, all the things Agnieszka isn t, and her dearest friend in the world. And there is no way to save her. But Agnieszka fears the wrong things. For when the Dragon comes, it is not Kasia he will choose.

Novelette: ["Our Lady of the Open Road"](http://www.sarahpinsker.com/our_lady_of_the_open_road/) by Sarah Pinsker

"The needle on the veggie oil tank read flat empty by the time we came to China Grove. A giant pink and purple fiberglass dragon loomed over the entrance, refugee from some shuttered local amusement park, no doubt; it looked more medieval than Chinese. The parking lot held a mix of Chauffeurs and manual farm trucks, but I didn't spot any other greasers, so I pulled in..."

Short Story: ["Hungry Daughters of Starving Mothers"](http://www.nightmare-magazine.com/fiction/hungry-daughters-of-starving-mothers/) by Alyssa Wong

"As my date—Harvey? Harvard?—brags about his alma mater and Manhattan penthouse, I take a bite of overpriced kale and watch his ugly thoughts swirl overhead. It’s hard to pay attention to him with my stomach growling and my body ajitter, for all he’s easy on the eyes. Harvey doesn’t look much older than I am, but his thoughts, covered in spines and centipede feet, glisten with ancient grudges and carry an entitled, Ivy League stink..."

Andre Norton Award for YA Science Fiction and Fantasy: [*Updraft*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780765377838) by Fran Wilde

Kirit Densira cannot wait to pass her wingtest and begin flying as a trader by her mother's side, being in service to her beloved home tower and exploring the skies beyond. When Kirit inadvertently breaks Tower Law, the city's secretive governing body, the Singers, demand that she become one of them instead. In an attempt to save her family from greater censure, Kirit must give up her dreams to throw herself into the dangerous training at the Spire, the tallest, most forbidding tower, deep at the heart of the City.

As she grows in knowledge and power, she starts to uncover the depths of Spire secrets. Kirit begins to doubt her world and its unassailable Laws, setting in motion a chain of events that will lead to a haunting choice, and may well change the city forever-if it isn't destroyed outright.
