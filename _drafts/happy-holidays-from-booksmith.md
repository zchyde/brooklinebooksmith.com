![](/uploads/versions/2016bestsellers---x----1000-637x---.jpg)There is no better place to be than Booksmith at holiday time. Lots of happy customers in the check out line have been telling us what we hoped to be true:â€‹**&nbsp;You only need to shop once, if your first stop is Booksmith.**

<br>
<br>A dear coworker passed this&nbsp;[Bing Crosby and David Bowie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADbJLo4x-tk) duet along to me, and if you can think of a better send-off for 2016, let me know. All of us at Brookline Booksmith wish you happy holidays, and the happiest of new years. Turn away from fake news, dial the love and friendship up to eleven, and read a few more books in 2017 than you did in 2016.&nbsp;

<br>ps - One last little gift for everyone is&nbsp;[radio.garden](http://radio.garden/live/), which is one of the best uses for the Internet yet. It gives that we-are-all-one-big-family feeling that ought to be cherished more than just once a year.
