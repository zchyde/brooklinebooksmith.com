I have always loved fairy tale re-tellings, and adaptations. I love how they can surprise you, add a twist you never thought of, shine light on the past of that villain you hated so much, and make you fall in love with them. Or they pick a new perspective, maybe from a side character, and you can see the story in a whole other way. There are millions of adaptations, 100's that come out each year, you might think to yourself just how many different versions of Wonderland could there POSSIBLY be?

Well millions and millions! Which delights me to no end!

SO, if your a book lover after my own heart, read on and discover some great alternative versions to the tales you love so much.

Since I mentioned Wonderland, lets start with this:

This one comes out May 3rd, and I already know this series is going to be a guilty pleasure of mine! I first discovered it via the [Epic Reads First 5](http://www.epicreads.com/first5/)newsletter. Which you need to sign up for because it is GREAT! Every morning you get an email with a chapter of a book (that isn't published yet!). You rate the chapter, and then the next day you get chapter 2.
