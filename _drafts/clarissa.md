I have always loved fairy tale re-tellings, and adaptations of classics. I love how they can surprise you, add a twist you never thought of, make you fall in love with a character you once hated. Sometimes it is told from a new perspective, maybe from a side character, and you can see the story in a whole other way. There are millions of adaptations, 100's that come out each year, and with each one a classic gains a new chapter and fresh life.

Here are some of my favorite YA re-tellings and adaptations that have come out in the past few years, and a couple that are yet to be!

I already know this series is going to be a guilty pleasure of mine! It tells the story of Dinah the Princess of Hearts, and future Queen of Wonderland. We see many of the classic characters, and meet a few new ones as well. I love a great villain, or villainess, but have never particularly liked the Queen of Hearts. She is cruel, spiteful, has a hairpin trigger, and YELLS so much (at least in the movies). However, when we meet Dinah this time around she is young, struggling not to cave under the oppression of her father, and just learning that Wonderland has some pretty dark secrets. It is essentially the tale of an underdog. Dinah isn't classically beautiful, she is grumpy, distrusting, and has no self confidence. All things most people can relate to, and relate I did!! Four chapters in and the rest of my day was dedicated to this book.

**Side note:**I first discovered *Queen of Hearts* via the [Epic Reads First 5](http://www.epicreads.com/first5/) newsletter. Which you need to sign up for because it is GREAT! You get a daily email with the first five chapters of a book, one chapter per day, and after reading you rate the portion you read. Its geat fun!

Next I want to introduce you to one of my favorite authors. She has created not one, but 3, fabulous re-tellings. I sincerely hope she continues to write many, because the worlds and characters she creates are incredible.

Introducing [Rosamund Hodge](http://www.rosamundhodge.net/)!

Her first book [Cruel Beauty](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062224743) is a drool worthy re-imagining of Beauty and the Beast. There is a magical library (of course!), a very angry teen named Nyx who wants nothing more than to escape her prescribed duty, and an evil ruler who plays the role of The Beast. It might sound like a pretty typical version of a well worn story, but I assure you it is anything but that.

[Crimson Bound](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062224767) is a mind bending and swoon worthy tribute to Little Red Ridding Hood. I loved the world Hodge built. Full of very mysterious magics, secrets, otherworldly forests, and shape shifters. In some ways this might be her most fairy-tale like so far, in that she doesn't fully explain the magic, or peoples, or religions. Something I have come to love in a book because then I can let my imagination run wild and fill in all the spaces.

[Bright Smoke C](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062369413)[old Fire](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/site/bright%2520smoke%2520cold%2520fire)&nbsp;(coming in the fall) is DELICIOUS. A re-imagining of Romeo and Juliet, Hodge went all out for this one. A doomed world, ancient magics, feuding families (of course), and dark plots. This is Hodge's strongest work so far. Her characters are bold, doomed, stubborn, and relatable. You won't want to miss it! Plus, isn't that cover KILLER?!

[Sara Rees Brennan](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/author/%22Brennan%2C%20Sarah%20Rees%22) is a staff favorite, and Amy just loved her latest novel, a retelling of Dicken's Tale of Two Cities.

"[Tell the Wind and Fire](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780544318175) is a bright and inventive retelling of Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities. It's sharp, entertaining, and full of echoes of the original. There's not a weak character in the lot and each of them earn every word their given with blood. Full of wit and brimming with action, it doesn't matter if you're a fan of Dickens or not you'll be hooked."

The last one I will leave you with is by Sara J Maas. She is most known perhaps, for her [Throne of Glass](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781619630345) series. Which I LOVE. But have you read [A](__notset__)[&nbsp;Court of Thorns and Roses](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781619635180)? It is a seriously juicy, saucy, and all around addicting re-imagining of Beauty and the Beast. Like, WHOA, she made me blush, heat up, and fall head over heals in love with her main hunk. Who happens to be a prince in a fairy realm, talk about unobtainable! The sequel, A Court of Mist and Fury ,comes out the first week in May and I am counting down the hours until I get my greedy hands on it.
