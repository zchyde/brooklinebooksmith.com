I have always loved fairy tale re-tellings, and classic adaptations. I love how they can surprise you, add a twist you never thought of, make you fall in love with a character you once hated. Sometimes it is told from a new perspective, maybe from a side character, and you can see the story in a whole other way. There are millions of adaptations, 100's that come out each year, and with each one a classic gains a new chapter.

SO, if your a book lover after my own heart, read on and discover some great alternative versions to the tales you love so much.

Since I mentioned Wonderland, lets start with this:

This one comes out May 3rd, and I already know this series is going to be a guilty pleasure of mine! I first discovered it via the [Epic Reads First 5](http://www.epicreads.com/first5/)newsletter. Which you need to sign up for because it is GREAT! Every morning you get an email with a chapter of a book (that isn't published yet!). You rate the chapter, and then the next day you get chapter 2.
