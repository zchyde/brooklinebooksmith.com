I have always loved fairy tale re-tellings, and adaptations of classics. I love how they can surprise you, add a twist you never thought of, make you fall in love with a character you once hated. Sometimes it is told from a new perspective, maybe from a side character, and you can see the story in a whole other way. There are millions of adaptations, 100's that come out each year, and with each one a classic gains a new chapter and fresh life.

Here are some of my favorite YA re-tellings and adaptations that have come out in the past few years, and a couple that are yet to be!

I already know this series is going to be a guilty pleasure of mine! It tells the story of Dinah the Princess of Hearts, and future Queen of Wonderland. We see many of the classic characters, and meet a few new ones as well. I love a great villain, or villainess, but have never particularly liked the Queen of Hearts. She is cruel, spiteful, has a hairpin trigger, and YELLS so much (at least in the movies). However, when we meet Dinah this time around she is young, struggling not to cave under the oppression of her father, and just learning that Wonderland has some pretty dark secrets. It is essentially the tale of an underdog. Dinah isn't classically beautiful, she is grumpy, distrusting, and has no self confidence. All things most people can relate to, and relate I did!! Four chapters in and the rest of my day was dedicated to this book.

**Side note:**I first discovered *Queen of Hearts* via the [Epic Reads First 5](http://www.epicreads.com/first5/) newsletter. Which you need to sign up for because it is GREAT! You get a daily email with the first five chapters of a book, one chapter per day, and after reading you rate the portion you read. Its great when a first chapter might have been ok, but then by chapter 4 your hooked! Which is exactly what happened with this one.
