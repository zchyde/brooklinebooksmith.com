I have always loved fairy tale re-tellings, and adaptations. I love how they can surprise you, add a twist you never thought of, shine light on the past of that villain you hated so much, and make you fall in love with them. Or they pick a new perspective, maybe from a side character, and you can see the story in a whole other way. There are millions of adaptations, 100's that come out each year, you might think to yourself just how many different versions of Wonderland could there POSSIBLY be?
