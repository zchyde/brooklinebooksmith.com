Claire Louise-Bennett's Pond is a series of musings about the mundane
<br>the more specific the image the more universal the message and Pond does that effortlessly. Beautiful ruminations on everyday life. stream of consciousness unnamed character narrator makes each honest depiction of life as though the reader were to the one narrating the minute observances
<br>isolation and seclusion is the first thing i think of as the long days of summer wear down and end sooner and sooner
<br>

<br>"In solitude you donâ€™t need to make an impression on the world, so the world has some opportunity to make an impression on you" Claire Louise-Bennett
