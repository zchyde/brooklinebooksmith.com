[Don't Be A Jerk](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781608683888) by Brad Warner

*Don't Be A Jerk* is a funny and candid approach to the deepest and most influential zen teaching – just don't be a jerk. &nbsp; Warner's title is a witty paraphrasing of Zen master Eihei Dogen's (1200-1253) *Treasury of the True Dharma Eye*.&nbsp; In plain English Warner explains the details of the ancient text.&nbsp; He expands on Dogen's themes of feminism, the process of cleaning and maintaining traditional robes, the depth of the Heart Sutra, and how to clean your butt.&nbsp; All of this without the traditional maps, genealogical charts, glossary, and bibliography to wade through.

For a truly relaxing read you might pick up Claire Louise-Bennett's&nbsp; [Pond](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780399575891)

This series of short stories quietly reflects on the everyday goings on of a small coastal Irish town.&nbsp; Bennett shines her literary light on seemingly ordinary things and the result is a pleasant meditation on solitude.&nbsp; *Pond*is a collection of musings – the conscious thoughts of an unnamed character.&nbsp; Each minute observance is an honest depiction of life in a secluded coastal Irish town.

<br>"In solitude you don’t need to make an impression on the world, so the world has some opportunity to make an impression on you" – Cliare Louise-Bennett for the [Irish Times](http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/claire-louise-bennett-on-writing-pond-1.2226535\)
