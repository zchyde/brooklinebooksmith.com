Two days from now, where will you be?

You will *probably*all be here, at the Booksmith, celebrating J.K. Rowling's triumphant dramatic return to the world of Harry Potter. [Harry Potter and the Cursed Child](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781338099133?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=harrypotter-2016) is a two-part play currently in previews at the [Palace Theatre, London](http://www.harrypottertheplay.com/), a nineteen-years-later continuation of the seven original books. Heinously, we can't all go to London; for us, however, there's the book! The printed version of the script is coming out on the stroke of midnight, Sunday, July 31.

We will be kicking off the book with a good old-fashioned midnight release party, with festivities starting at 9P.M. Saturday. You should absolutely join us! Read on for more information about what we're doing (and what you can therefore also do).

What is the point of being sorted if you can't compete against the other, much less awesome houses? House points are won by participating in trivia, arriving in costume, finishing crosswords and word searches, and finding the items in our scavenger hunt.

You can also get points by **sharing on our social media**.
