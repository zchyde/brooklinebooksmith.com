Two days from now, where will you be?

You will *probably*all be here, at the Booksmith, celebrating J.K. Rowling's triumphant dramatic return to the world of Harry Potter. [Harry Potter and the Cursed Child](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781338099133?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=harrypotter-2016) is a two-part play currently in previews at the [Palace Theatre, London](http://www.harrypottertheplay.com/), a nineteen-years-later continuation of the seven original books. Heinously, we can't all go to London; for us, however, there's hope! The printed version of the script is coming out on the stroke of midnight, Sunday, July 31.

We will be kicking off the book with a good old-fashioned midnight release party, with festivities starting at 9P.M. You should absolutely join us! Here is what you need to know:

* You can [**preorder**](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781338099133?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=harrypotter-2016)the book or **purchase at our release party** for 20% off the cover price. This discount only applies to preorders (picked up at any time) and books purchased in the store between **12 midnight and closing**on Saturday night.
* Starting at **8:30A.M. on Saturday**, receive a numbered wristband at the front register to reserve your spot in line.
