Fall is here and sweaters are out in force. The air is crisp and the leaves are starting to turn, setting the mood for my favorite holiday - Halloween!

That means COSTUMES. As happens every year I have about a million ideas of who I want to be and 90% of them are book characters! The challenge however, is to find the delicate balance between a character people will actually recognize (since I have managed to maintain friendships outside of the book world), but also one that everyone under the sun won't be dressing up as! A challenge indeed.

Princess and the Pony

Hilda

Ms Marvel

Lumberjanes
