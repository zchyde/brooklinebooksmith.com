Fall is here and sweaters are out in force. The air is crisp and the leaves are starting to turn, setting the mood for my favorite holiday - Halloween!

That means COSTUMES. As happens every year I have about a million ideas of who I want to be and 90% of them are book characters! The challenge however, is to find the delicate balance between a character people will actually recognize (since I have managed to maintain friendships outside of the book world), but also one that everyone under the sun won't be dressing up as! A challenge indeed.

So here are a few of the characters my bookseller heart wishes to see this Halloween:

[Ada Twist Scientist by Andrea Beaty ill. by David Roberts](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781419721373) - how cute this costume would be! Not to mention super easy: polka dot dress, pig tails, goggles, plastic gloves, polka dot socks and some cute shoes! Oh and don't forget the note pad, pencil and QUESTIONS!

[Peter Brown](http://www.peterbrownstudio.com/), author of many delightful picture books graced us earlier this year with his first middle grade novel [Wild Robot](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316381994). Who wouldn't want to be a robot for halloween?! In the story Roz, a robot stranded on an island, adopts a little duckling and raises him with the help of her new forest friends. You could go delightfully old school with lots of tin foil and cardboard, then add in a cute stuffed duckling and away you go! What fun!

Now this next one would be a beautiful labor of love but boy would it be worth it! [Tony DiTerlizzi](http://diterlizzi.com/home/art-gallery/) is author and illustrator of one of my all time favorite books [The Search for WondLa](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781416983118), the first in a very delightful trilogy. A futuristic scifi adventure for middle grades (and everyone else!), this would be a challenging costume sure to turn heads.
