"The FBI’s investigation included sending their sources to the bookstore, and tasking them with attending certain lectures hosted at Burning Books. The investigation started as a result of &nbsp;Pickering’s ties to the Earth Liberation Front (ELF), a radical environmental group known for a series of fire-bombings in the 1990s... Pickering acknowledges his links to the ELF, but alleges that he did nothing illegal."

"In July of last year, Pickering set up a multimedia exhibit designed to shine a light on the FBI’s use of surveillance. Speaking to the Buffalo News when it opened, he told them he hoped it would pose the question, “‘Is this free speech or criminal activity?…It will also raise the question, ‘Did the FBI engage in criminal activity?’”
