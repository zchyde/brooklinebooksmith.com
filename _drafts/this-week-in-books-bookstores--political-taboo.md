It's been a tumultuous week in the world of independent bookselling. In Buffalo, NY, the FBI revealed a two-year investigation of [Burning Books](http://burningbooksbuffalo.com/) to the public. From the opposite flank, literary institution [Tattered Cover Book Store](http://www.tatteredcover.com/) in Denver, CO, found itself the target of the anarchist organization [Anonymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_%28group%29).

In the first case, Burning Books is a community hub for activist resources which bills itself as "books, media and events on freedom struggle." As [Melville House reports](http://www.mhpbooks.com/fbi-investigated-buffalo-bookstore-owner-for-over-two-years/), the Federal Bureau of Investigation monitored owner Leslie Pickering for two years on suspicion of eco-terrorism.

> The FBI’s investigation included sending their sources to the bookstore, and tasking them with attending certain lectures hosted at Burning Books. The investigation started as a result of &nbsp;Pickering’s ties to the Earth Liberation Front (ELF), a radical environmental group known for a series of fire-bombings in the 1990s… Pickering acknowledges his links to the ELF, but alleges that he did nothing illegal.

In the wake of the investigation, Pickering denounced the investigation's foundation and methods, and countered with his own artistic protest:

> In July of last year, Pickering set up a multimedia exhibit designed to shine a light on the FBI’s use of surveillance. Speaking to the Buffalo News when it opened, he told them he hoped it would pose the question, “‘Is this free speech or criminal activity?…It will also raise the question, ‘Did the FBI engage in criminal activity?’"

By contrast, Tattered Cover found itself on the right side of the law but the wrong side of its critics, specifically the leaderless anarchist group [Anonymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_%28group%29), notorious for its hacktivist methods. The dispute arose after the city of Denver undertook a campaign to "clean up" homeless encampments, posting notice 24 hours before officials cleared sites of any remaining structures or possessions. Anonymous decried the city's actions as inhumane (watch the official protest video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koK0S_13zX8)), and found the bookstore guilty by association because of its membership in the Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP), a merchant collective that has expressed support for the sweeps. Tattered Cover itself has not taken a stance, but its detractors launched attacks against the bookstore's website and threatened to publicly punish individuals tied to Denver's campaign through doxing, or the release of personal information such as phone numbers and home addresses that make its victims easy targets for online harassment (read the story in more detail [here](http://www.mhpbooks.com/anonymous-targets-denvers-tattered-cover-book-store-over-citys-handling-of-homeless/)).

Tattered Cover owner Len Vlahos responded with a statement to the [American Booksellers Association](http://www.bookweb.org/news/anonymous-targets-city-denver-tattered-cover):

> Our refusal to take a stance on matters of public policy is principled; our customers need to know that they have unfettered access to books and content without fear of judgment or reprisal. The opponents of the camping ban know this, but have chosen to ignore it... Because Tattered Cover has a very potent brand name in Denver, and because our customer base is a very desirable demographic, they feel they can make hay by targeting us. The protests against Tattered Cover—and, of course, we support any citizen’s right to protest in a peaceful and civil way — as well as the illegal assault on Tattered Cover’s website is tactical, not philosophical.

For the record, Brookline Booksmith subscribes to the same policy of neutrality as Tattered Cover, though we support the efforts and resources offered by stores like Burning Books and, more locally, the [Lucy Parsons Center](http://lucyparsons.org/). Our doors and pages are forever open to one and all, regardless of belief.
