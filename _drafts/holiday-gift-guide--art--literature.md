**![](/uploads/9780300211917.jpg)Leap Before You Look: Black Mountain College 1933-1957** by Helen Molesworth, with Ruth Erickson ([**Buy**](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780300211917))

Twenty-four years was all the time it was given, but the influence of Black Mountain College endures all the way to the present. From 1933-1957, the rural college founded by John Rice (“We must realize that the world as it is isn't worth saving; it must be made over.”) operated self-sufficiently, with men and women sharing equally the joys and toils of building, harvesting, and, of course, providing world-class instruction to a crop of young artists in every creative field imaginable. This book, companion to the ICA exhibit, is the closest thing to being a student in that briefly-realized-utopia, Black Mountain College.

**![](/uploads/9780691165288.jpg)Mathematics & Art: A Cultural History** by Lynn Gamwell, with a foreword by Neil deGrasse Tyson ([**Buy**](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780691165288))

If you think about it in terms of Smartphones and Big Data, it seems a relatively new phenomenon, the way that zeroes and ones are woven into every facet of our lives. But really, the language of mathematics has always been with us, waiting to be deciphered bit by bit, helping us in our quest to better know our world and ourselves. Lynn Gamwell’s monumental study illuminates the people and ideas who have pushed at the boundaries of mathematics and art, and demonstrates how, when they intersect, masterpieces come into being.

**[![](/uploads/9781936976867.jpg)](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781936976867)Plotted: A Literary Atlas** by Andrew DeGraff and Daniel Harmon ([**Buy**](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781936976867))

Andrew DeGraff offers a master-class in information design in *Plotted: A Literary Atlas*. He charts the path of each of Hamlet’s characters through the cut-away halls and corridors of Elsinore Castle; distills into one iconic image the tight orbit and existential angst of Waiting for Godot; winds page after page down the lazy Mississippi with Huck Finn; and zooms out to follow the claustrophobic car ride, the worst family road trip ever, in Flannery O'Connor’s A Good Man Is Hard To Find.

Pepper your holiday cheer with a stocking full of groans this year by giving someone on your list Frida Clement's *Have a Little Pun*. "NICE MUSSELS" compliments the pile of mussels, but the trio of yaks don't hear because "YAK YAK YAK.” I agree with the sheep, "EWE CRAZY" if you don't buy this book.

**![](/uploads/9781910620007.jpg)101 Artists to Listen to Before You Die** by Ricardo Cavolo&nbsp; 9781910620007

Shrewd editorial decision, keeping that number down low. Usually these before-you-die lists clock out at 1,001, making it an impossibility to actually complete the job in one lifetime. Bonus: everyone is going to have a legit beef with the list, because it inevitably leaves off one or more of your favorite artists! Well done, Ricardo Cavolo, your book (the brilliantly illustrated diary of his musical awakening, actually) is both debate-worthy and actionable.

**![](/uploads/9781616892920.jpg)Presenting Shakespeare: 1,100 Posters from Around the World** by Mirko Ilic and Steven Heller, preface by Julie Taymor&nbsp; 9781616892920

Shakespeare's themes are universal and timeless - they lend themselves to being reworked into different eras and locations. And if such license is given to the director, the same must be extended to the designer…of the show's poster. Each of the plays' posters are grouped together, highlighting the dramatic variety of approaches taken by designers representing 56 countries, from the nineteenth century to the present day.

**![](/uploads/9780393245431.jpg)The Annotated Alice: 150th Anniversary Deluxe Edition** by Lewis Carroll, edited by Martin Gardner and Mark Burnstein, illustrated by John Tenniel 9780393245431

Even the most knowledgeable devotees of Alice’s adventures will find innumerable gems in the columns of *The Annotated Alice*. The roots of Lewis Carroll's creation are at times even more fascinating than the book itself. This 150th anniversary edition - with its copious side notes and illustrations dating from the original version to the present day - is a fantastically twisting and turning rabbit hole in and of itself.
