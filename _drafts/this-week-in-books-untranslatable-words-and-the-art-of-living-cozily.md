I'm calling it right now; the Next Big Thing in publishing is going to be *Hygge*. British news source *The Guardian* [lays it out for us](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/11/hygge-the-danish-art-of-living-cosily-on-its-way-to-uk-bookshops):

> Pronounced, approximately, hue-ga, hygge loosely translates as cosiness, but means more than that. Itâ€™s about a feeling of wellbeing, about enjoying life, whether through time spent with close friends or family, sitting by a fire with a hot chocolate, or putting on warm socks and dry clothes after a rainstorm.

In the immortal words of Futurama cartoon character Fry, "Shut up and take my money!"
