Austrian-British logical philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein once famously said:

The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.

That idea, that the scope of our understanding is defined by what we can and cannot put words to, holds particular fascination to the avid reader - books, after all, should be our window onto the world. It's unsettling to imagine societies that lack concepts fundamental to our view of the world, like words for [right & left](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1m6l0b/til_there_are_languages_without_the_terms_left/), [yes & no](http://mentalfloss.com/article/49480/8-fun-facts-about-irish-language), or [the color blue](http://io9.gizmodo.com/5902904/why-do-cultures-always-name-red-before-they-do-blue).

Even more perturbing are those ideas that underpin the principles of cultures but have no direct translation into our own language (heck, we can order you a whole book of them). There's no shortage of examples:

> Pronounced, approximately, hue-ga, hygge loosely translates as cosiness, but means more than that. Itâ€™s about a feeling of wellbeing, about enjoying life, whether through time spent with close friends or family, sitting by a fire with a hot chocolate, or putting on warm socks and dry clothes after a rainstorm.

WHOA. That's all the best things ever, right? Better than [raindrops on roses AND whiskers on kittens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33o32C0ogVM) put together. Last year saw the explosive proliferation of KonMari, the word coined by its namesake Mari Kondo as the name for her infamous tidying system. Hygge stands poised to carry KonMari's torch as a testament to our thirst for l
