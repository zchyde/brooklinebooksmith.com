Austrian-British logical philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein once famously said:

> The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.

That idea, that the scope of our understanding is defined by what we can and cannot put words to, holds particular fascination to the avid reader - books, after all, should be our window onto the world. It's unsettling to imagine societies that lack concepts fundamental to our self-perception, like words for [right & left](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1m6l0b/til_there_are_languages_without_the_terms_left/), [yes & no](http://mentalfloss.com/article/49480/8-fun-facts-about-irish-language), or [the color blue](http://io9.gizmodo.com/5902904/why-do-cultures-always-name-red-before-they-do-blue).

Even more perturbing are those ideas that underpin other cultures but have no direct translation into our own language. There's no shortage of examples (heck, we can order you [a whole book of them](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781607747109)). Per [lingholic](http://www.lingholic.com/15-untranslatable-words-wish-existed-english/), there's the German *Extrawunsch*,&nbsp; "an additional request which turns a simple delivery/operation/undertaking into a complicated one, often with only a marginal benefit"; the Kimbundu word *Cacimbo*, "synonymous for the cool season… upon hearing the word, Angolans would just think about the fresh air, the summer, the cool weather and the very cold water"; the Inuit idea of *Iktsuarpok*, "the feeling of anticipation that leads you to go outside and check if anyone is coming"; and *Mokita*, from the Papua New Guinea language Kivila, meaning "the truth we all know but agree not to talk about."Anyone curious about the school of thought behind the Japanese *wabi sabi* (roughly, the beauty wrought by simplicity, irregularity and age) should check out Junichiro Tanizaki's incredible essay "[In Praise of Shadows"](http://dcrit.sva.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/In-Praise-of-Shadows-Junichiro-Tanizaki.pdf) (although even this treatise comes to us in translation, and thus can only ever approximate the idea).

Of course, languages borrow and repurpose words all the time as their speakers adapt to the changing world. The latest of these imported neologisms is the Danish word *Hygge*, which comes to our attention by way of British news source [*The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/11/hygge-the-danish-art-of-living-cosily-on-its-way-to-uk-bookshops):

> Pronounced, approximately, hue-ga, hygge loosely translates as cosiness, but means more than that. It’s about a feeling of wellbeing, about enjoying life, whether through time spent with close friends or family, sitting by a fire with a hot chocolate, or putting on warm socks and dry clothes after a rainstorm.

WHOA. That's better than [raindrops on roses AND whiskers on kittens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33o32C0ogVM) put together. A year after the explosive proliferation of *KonMari*, coined by its namesake Mari Kondo ([*The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781607747307)) as the name for her infamous tidying system, Hygge stands poised to carry the torch of our lifestyle aspirations. All that decluttering merits a little celebratory coziness amidst one's treasured possessions. You can preorder your copy of *[How to Hygge: The Danish Secrets of a Healthy, Happy Life](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781250122032)*, and other titles in its spirit cannot be far behind.

BONUS READ: In recent anthropological linguistics news, the results of a crowd-funding project launched to document Cree, the most widely spoken indigenous language in Canada, and to coin new words for its expanded culture, is nearing publication:

> [The lexicon includes] entries ranging from pw&acirc;kamo-pahkw&ecirc;sikan, the Cree word for pizza – “the throw-up bread” in literal English – to m&ocirc;niy&acirc;w-matotis&acirc;n, a sauna or a “white-man sweat”
