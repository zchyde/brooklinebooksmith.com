Roughly 18 months ago [LitHub](http://lithub.com/)(top-notch news source, [Booksmith book-talk collaborator](http://lithub.com/?s=brookline+booksmith) and publisher of Rebecca Solnitt in all [her](http://lithub.com/rebecca-solnit-the-case-of-the-missing-perpetrator/) [acerbic](http://lithub.com/men-explain-lolita-to-me/) [brilliance](http://lithub.com/80-books-no-woman-should-read/)) put out one of my favorite literary articles, "[10 Great Writers Nobody Reads](http://lithub.com/ten-great-writers-nobody-reads/)". It's the internet version of why I spend my days off crawling through stack after teetering stack of books in the dusty corners of dilapidated used book stores -it's not because old books smell great ([they do](http://emilygould.tumblr.com/post/86237068875/three-fragrances-for-people-who-love-old-book)), it's so I can unearth something mind-blowing that would otherwise find itself consigned to the abyss.

So last week when LitHub released a follow-up piece, "[10 More Writers Nobody Reads](http://lithub.com/10-more-writers-nobody-reads/)", I was giddy. Alas, many of the authors are languishing out of print but there are several that we'll be bringing to Brookline post-haste (and the first two titles make a great pair, no?). By this time next week you should see:

Plus, there's always the [Used Book Cellar](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/used-books/) to tickle your more esoteric fancies. I've seen several of these names pass through our inventory (that's where I first encountered Kavan's *Ice*, actually.) If that doesn't keep you busy, several independent presses are dedicated to bringing old masterpieces out of the ether - [Dalkey Archive](http://www.dalkeyarchive.com/) is a favorite, but hit us up for more suggestions! Meanwhile if you need me, I'll be nose-deep in *Berg*.
