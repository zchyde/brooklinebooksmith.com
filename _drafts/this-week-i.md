Roughly 18 months ago [LitHub](http://lithub.com/)(top-notch news source, [Booksmith book-talk collaborator](http://lithub.com/?s=brookline+booksmith) and publisher of Rebecca Solnitt in all [her](http://lithub.com/rebecca-solnit-the-case-of-the-missing-perpetrator/) [acerbic](http://lithub.com/men-explain-lolita-to-me/) [brilliance](http://lithub.com/80-books-no-woman-should-read/)) put out one of my favorite literary articles, "[10 Great Writers Nobody Reads](http://lithub.com/ten-great-writers-nobody-reads/)". It's the internet version of why I spend my days off crawling through stack after teetering stack of books in the dusty corners of dilapidated used book stores -it's not because old books smell great ([they do](http://emilygould.tumblr.com/post/86237068875/three-fragrances-for-people-who-love-old-book)), it's so I can unearth something mind-blowing that would otherwise find itself consigned to the abyss.

So last week when LitHub released a follow-up piece, "[10 More Writers Nobody Reads](http://lithub.com/10-more-writers-nobody-reads/)", I was giddy. Many of these authors are languishing out of print but there are several that we'll be bringing to Brookline post-haste (and the first two titles make a great pair, no?).

By this time next week you should see ***[Ice](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780720612684)*******by Anna Kavan; [***Berg***](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781564783028) by Ann Quin (a good pair of titles, right?); [***The Exquisite Corpse***](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781574231977) by Alfred Chester; and The Trumpets of Jericho by Unica Z&uuml;rn.

Of course there's always the Used Book Cellar to tickle your more esoteric fancies. I've seen several of these names pass through our inventory (that's where I first encountered Kavan's "Ice", in fact.) Feel free to hit us up for recommendations of other forgotten classics too!
