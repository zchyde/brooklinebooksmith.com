![](/uploads/versions/ducklings---x----1364-938x---.jpg)My seven-year-old daughter found something in&nbsp;*Make Way for Ducklings*&nbsp;that I never saw before. There's a frog down there! Kids see everything. She also claims she never read the book before. Kids lie all the time. (By the way, on the book's [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_Way_for_Ducklings)&nbsp;page, it is noted that McCloskey's masterpiece "was criticised for having a loose plot…as well as poor characterization." Huh?)

From time to time I get a look of disbelief from a customer when I admit that I haven't read the hot new book they are looking for. You haven't read this yet?! Part of me wants to theatrically sweep my arm across the&nbsp;[panorama](http://www.notesontheroad.com/Ying-s-Links/Stockholm-Public-Library-Imagined-by-Olivier-Charles.html)&nbsp;of thousands upon thousands of books before us, but I keep that to myself and instead just tell them that personally I am drawn to older books, books that have stood the test of time. What we in the biz call "backlist" titles. Listen, I have kids. I don't like to gamble with my reading time. Here's some of my fellow booksellers enthusing over their&nbsp;[favorite backlist books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMyH8Nc6qYI&amp;feature=youtu.be).

We still have&nbsp;[Donna Leon](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-03/donna-leon-the-waters-of-eternal-youth/)&nbsp;tickets for next week available, so make that happen&nbsp;[here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/donna-leon-330-tickets-21783461921), or by calling us at 617-566-6660. And did you know that we're starting up a book club for 5th-8th grade readers? Our Between the Lines club is reading&nbsp;[Running Out of Time](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780689812361), so do the same, and join the discussion on Tuesday, 3/29 at 4:30pm.

In closing, congratulations to Reginald Dwayne Betts, author of staff favorite (and recent Small Press Book Club pick)&nbsp;[Bastards of the Reagan Era](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781935536659)&nbsp;and now winner of the 2016 [PEN New England award for Poetry](http://www.pen-ne.org/pen-new-england-awards).

Wait, one more thing:&nbsp;[I found where I want to retire](http://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/movies/a19929/popeye-village/?dom=fb_ao&amp;src=social&amp;mag=pop). Any costumed re-enactors will have to beat it, though. I ain'ts gots no paish-kence for 'em.

Thanks for reading,Paul
