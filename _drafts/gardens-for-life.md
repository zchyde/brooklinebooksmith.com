Permaculture was founded in 1968 by [Bill Mollison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mollison) and [David Holmgren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Holmgren).&nbsp; It's appropriate to be talking about permaculture since we just lost the father of permacultre just last month.&nbsp; At the age of 88â€¦.&nbsp; Permaculture has 3 core values: care for the planet, care for people, and return the surplus.&nbsp; These ideas are certainly ones for our everyday lives!&nbsp; Too, it's never too early to plant your garden for the spring.
