Gardens offer lessons on life; the whole-system approach of permaculture does just this.&nbsp; Permaculture was co-founded in 1968 by [Bill Mollison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mollison) and [David Holmgren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Holmgren).&nbsp; Permaculture is a design system for ecological and sustainable living, integrating plants, animals, buildings, people, and communities.&nbsp; Permaculture has 3 core values: care for the planet, care for people, and return the surplus.&nbsp; These ideas are certainly ones for our everyday lives.&nbsp; Here are some books that will have you developing, arranging, and planting your sustainable gardens soon. &nbsp;&nbsp;

[<u>Practical Permaculture</u>](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781604694437) by Jessi Bloom and Dave Boehnlein is an easy-to-use eco-guide.&nbsp; This book helps to break down the many aspects of permaculture into a "can do" opportunity instead of an overwhelming “job.”

[![](/uploads/versions/gaias-garden---x----320-400x---.jpg)](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781603580298)Toby Hemenway, student of the father of permaculture (Mollison), wrote 2 excellent guides on this garden phenomenon.&nbsp; Mollison once revealed to Hemenway where he got the original concept for permaculture in 1959.&nbsp; In the Tasmanian rainforest, Mollison spent time watching the behavior of marsupials, and noticed how interwoven the ecosystem was.&nbsp; It has been reported that Mollison penned in his diary the following [statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mollison): "'I believe that we could build systems that would function as well as this one does.’”&nbsp; Hemenway’s first focus-guide on permaculture was [Gaia's Garden](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781603580298).&nbsp; In his second book [The Permaculture City](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781603585262), Hemenway took the resilient country-garden idea and brought it to the next level, our cities.[![](/uploads/versions/per---x----316-400x---.jpg)](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781603585262)---

Many garden-enthusiasts gather inspiration from planting their flowers, trees, and veggies.&nbsp; If you're feeling a bit "under-whelmed" with your eco-inspiration, look to these two beautiful poetry collections from the Everyman's Library Pocket Poets Series: [Echoing Green: Poems of Fields, Meadows, and Grasses](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781101907733)&nbsp; and [Garden Poems](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780679447269).

[![](/uploads/versions/garden-poems---x----285-400x---.jpg)](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780679447269)You’ll unearth some seasonal poems, like “An October Garden” by Christina Rossetti&nbsp; or “Autumn Garden” by Dino Campana.

[![](/uploads/versions/perma-for-rest-of-us---x----267-400x---.jpg)](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780865718104)What if we all could really live on just one acre of land?&nbsp; [Permaculture for the Rest of Us](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780865718104) by Jenni Blackmore will tell you how.[![](/uploads/versions/perma-promise---x----311-400x---.jpg)](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781612124278)What can permaculture teach us about our future?&nbsp; Coming out at the end of November is Jono Neiger's book [The Permaculture Promise](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781612124278).&nbsp; &nbsp;Neiger looks at the core values of permaculture, and seeks to utilize these ideals, like its long-range focus, to discover gardening techniques for solutions to climate change, for re-energizing our eco-actions, and for creating more resilient communities.

So I’ll leave you with some words of wisdom: “Humankind has not woven the web of life.&nbsp; We are but one thread within it.&nbsp; Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves.&nbsp; All things are bound together.&nbsp; All things connect.” –Chief Seattle
