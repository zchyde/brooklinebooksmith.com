Born on 28 July 1866, the world-renowned children's book author and illustrator just celebrated her 150th birthday!

During the month of June, I spent a bit of time in England and Scotland studying British Libraries and Archives with the University of Southern Mississippi. A fascinating trip all around, but one of the things that truly made my childlike heart soar was the day we visited the Beatrix Potter archives at Blythe House!Though Beatrix Potter is often portrayed as having had a rather sad childhood, archivist Emma Laws brought up a rather interesting point, "You can't believe everything people say in a journal because when people write their personal thoughts, it can often be a load of nonsense."&nbsp; As a young girl who kept journals of her own, I have to say I believe her! Emotions do not translate well to paper, and the things we write in their midst are often absurdly one-sided. Laws went on to explain a bit about Potter's life. She had a rather fortunate, and quite typical, middle-class upbringing for the time–holidaying in Scotland every summer, and treated to the best education her parents could find. Potter did not move away from London, where she lived with her parents until she was 47 years old. As a child, she was not overly sentimental and often drew dead animals. She was very fascinated by the natural world around her, and as her artistic talents grew, so did her imagination it seems. Her stories of Peter Rabbit, Squirrel Nutkin, et al. started as letters to the children of her much-beloved governess. As you can see from the pictures below, they grew very organically. She had a natural ability just to know where to insert pictures. There were very few changes between the letters and the actual stories themselves.

One of the most interesting stories that Emma shared with us was that of Potter's views on marriage. She fell in love and became secretly engaged to her publisher Norman Warne. Her parents did not approve of the engagement, but their disapproval was not long lived. A month after becoming engaged, Warne died of leukemia. Emma pointed out to us that Beatrix essentially suffered in silence after his death. You were nobody in society as a woman until you were married–which didn't happen for her until she was 47. This explains why she described marriage as, "the crown of a woman's life." With marriage came a new found freedom, and Potter's motivation for writing and illustrating had virtually come to an end.
