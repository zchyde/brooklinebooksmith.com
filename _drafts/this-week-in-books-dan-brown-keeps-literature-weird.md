While some authors craft [contemporary works we'll never get to see](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/this-week-in-books/2016/06/06/this-week-in-books-by-the-time-david-mitchell-s-next-book-comes-out-we-ll-all-be-dead/), Dan Brown, the internationally best-selling author best known for [*The Da Vinci Code*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780307474278), is bringing historical literature to the general public - but not, this time, with his own work. Brown's fans will be familiar with the writer's passion for cryptography - the plots of [his popular thrillers](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/author/%22Brown%2C%20Dan%22) frequently hinge on some long-forgotten code or archaic mysticism. Brown conducted much of his research into ritual, myth and the bizarre at a [specialist Dutch library](http://www.ritmanlibrary.com/), and that institution will benefit from his recent grant of €300,000 ($339,195). *The Guardian* [reports](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/17/dan-brown-donates-300000-to-digitise-mystical-books-that-inspired-him):

> Brown’s gift to Amsterdam’s Ritman Library, which is also known as the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica, will go towards digitising and preserving its core collection so that the texts might be viewable online by the public. The library holds around 4,600 manuscripts and books that were printed before 1900, and about 20,000 printed after 1900, covering topics including alchemy and mysticism.

> In a [YouTube video, where he appears from behind a revolving bookcase in his personal library](http://www.ritmanlibrary.com/2016/06/author-dan-brown-donates-to-digitize-ancient-texts/), Brown said that… “[The library is] currently embarking on a bold quest to digitise and preserve an enormous part of their collection, and I feel very honoured to play a small part in that process. I look forward with enormous anticipation to the day coming very soon when people around the world will be able to access these texts.” The library hopes that its core collection will be available online by next spring.
