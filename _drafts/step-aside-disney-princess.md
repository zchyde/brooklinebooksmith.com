Like much of the Children's section Graphic novels are BOOMING here at the 'Smith. Not only the Children's Graphic novels either.&nbsp;

But today Children's is our focus.

Specifically kick-butt lady 'centric I'm not helpless graphic novels. Which are not just for girls by the way.&nbsp;

So.

Let's started with [Lumberjanes](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781608866878)[&nbsp;by Noel Stevenson, Grace Ellis, and Brooke Allen](__notset__)&nbsp;(which you've probably already read because why would you NOT have read Lumberjanes)

Lumberjanes is like the Girl Scout camp we all really wish we went to. It is for HARDCORE LADY TYPES ONLY which is a good thing because our gang gets caught up in some rather fishy activities. Wrestling sea monsters from a canoe, running into some emo yetis, and saving those helpless Boy Scouts when they foolishly get brainwashed.

Noel Stevenson also wrote and illustrated***Nimona***(http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062278227) which is one of my favorite stand alone graphic novels out there.

---

![](/uploads/versions/nimona---x----267-400x---.jpg)There is so much going on in this story. Nimona is a shapeshifter who isn't quite sure she likes herself. When you think your a monster how could you? I love her will all my heart, she is so relatable and we all at one point or another face the questions she is asking herself. If you want a graphic novel you will read again and again, and can have a great conversation about this is certainly a prime option.

---

A little more obscure but only in it's graphic novel form, ***Nausicaa: of the Valley of the Wind by Hayao Miyazaki*** (http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781591164081) is just breath taking.

---

![](/uploads/versions/nausicaa-volume-1-cover-1591164087---x----212-300x---.jpg)Most people know him best from his incredible animated movies ( Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Ponyo, My Neighbor Totoro ). He did make Nausicaa into a full length movie (which I LOVE) but he also hand illustrated and wrote all 7 volumes of Nausicaa's story. It goes much deeper into the environmental destruction of the world ( a classic Miyazaki trope ), and really brings Nausicaa herself to even more vivid life. As far as strong heroines go, she is top of my list.

This beautiful quote graces the cover of ***Princeless Vol 1 by Jeremy Whitley and M. Goodwin.***(http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781939352545)******&nbsp;and I could not agree more.

First off DIVERSITY. Secondly, no damsels in distress! Third, practical armor! Which leads to one of my favorite Princeless moments when Adrienne (pictured on the cover) goes in search of armor and well... these two snippets should give you an idea of how she reacts:

So. Brilliant. The humor is spot on, and the girl power is perfect. It only gets better as the story goes on too!

---

Lastly, I have to give Marvel a big high five. I am so proud to champion their new Marvel Now! stories. Not only are these great series for kids but they also have so much in there for the adult audience. What could be better than super heroine (or hero) series that the entire family gets a kick out of?&nbsp;

---

Yup, I am head over heels in love with Kamala Khan!

The new ***Ms Marvel by G Willow Wilson and Adrian Alphona***(http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780785190219) is just perfect in all ways as far as I'm concerned. Religion, friends, school, overbearing parents (that we love anyway), action, adventure... you name it Ms Marvel has it.**&nbsp;It is brilliantly written and ingeniously illustrated. Certainly a series that you would read over and over and over.

SO, did I add to your reading list? I certainly hope so! These are by far not the only great graphic novels we have (not even all the girl centric ones!) so if you want even more recommendations just roll on in and ask us!&nbsp;
