Like much of the Children's section Graphic novels are BOOMING here at the 'Smith. Not only the Children's Graphic novels either.&nbsp;

But today Children's is our focus.

Specifically kick-butt lady 'centric I'm not helpless graphic novels. Which are not just for girls by the way.&nbsp;

So.

Let's started with [Lumberjanes](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781608866878)[&nbsp;by Noel Stevenson, Grace Ellis, and Brooke Allen](__notset__)&nbsp;(which you've probably already read because why would you NOT have read Lumberjanes)

![](/uploads/versions/lumberjanes---x----260-400x---.jpg)![](/uploads/versions/lumberjanes2---x----260-400x---.jpg)Lumberjanes is like the Girl Scout camp we all really wish we went to. It is for HARDCORE LADY TYPES ONLY which is a good thing because our gang gets caught up in some rather fishy activities. Wrestling sea monsters from a canoe, running into some emo yetis, and saving those helpless Boy Scouts when they foolishly get brainwashed.

Noel Stevenson also wrote and illustrated Nimona which is one of my favorite stand alone graphic novels out there.
