![](/uploads/versions/readingbycandle---x----524-480x---.jpg)Looking out the store windows yesterday afternoon at around 3:30, and it felt like nighttime with all of those rain&nbsp;[clouds](https://cloudappreciationsociety.org/) blocking out the sun (which had probably already sunk below the&nbsp;[Coolidge Corner Theatre](http://www.coolidge.org/films/planet-apes)&nbsp;marquee anyway.) Not usually one to complain at the&nbsp;[changing of the seasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1fSSruXPCY), even to me this seems a little much. What to do with these long, dark&nbsp;[tea-times of the soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpF8QQpRPO4)&nbsp;in the months ahead? Well, Booksmith, as usual, has a ton of reasons to get out and about in the evening. Here's some of the highlights for the rest of November:
<br>
<br>[Daniel Levitin](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-11/daniel-levitin---a-field-guide-to-lies-critical-thinking-in-the-information-age/)&nbsp;- A Field Guide to Lies: Critical Thinking in the Information Age
<br>[E.M. Ben Shaul](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-11/e-m--ben-shaul-flying-without-a-net/)&nbsp;- Flying Without a Net
<br>[Michael Chabon](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/michael-chabon-1128-tickets-28393538839)&nbsp;- Moonglow
<br>[Ferrante Fever!](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-11/brookline-booksmith-and-wbur-present-a-night-of-ferrante-fever-her-novels--her-letters--her-legend-/)&nbsp;- panel discussion in celebration of Frantumaglia with author Claire Messud, Vogue book critic Megan O'Grady, publisher Michael Reynolds, her translator Ann Goldstein, and WBUR's Christopher Lydon.
<br>
<br>And our book clubs! On 11/21 at 7pm The&nbsp;[Small Press Book Club](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-11/small-press-book-club/)&nbsp;will be discussing&nbsp;[Colonel L&aacute;grimas](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781632061034)&nbsp;by Carlos Fonseca. Next up for our venerable&nbsp;[Book Club](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-12/book-club/)&nbsp;on 12/12 at 7:30pm will be Adam Johnson's&nbsp;[Fortune Smiles](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780812987232).&nbsp;
<br>
<br>If you're looking to join a Presidential-themed book club, our shelves have always got a copy of&nbsp;[All Quiet On the Western Front](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780449213940). Or you might get started on this&nbsp;[must-read list](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/books/6-books-to-help-understand-trumps-win.html?_r=1), all of which are either in stock or on their way to the store.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Before we move on to this week's hand-picked selection of books, gifts and the find of the week, take a moment and&nbsp;[enjoy this essay](https://www.grubstreet.org/blog/running-away-a-writer-on-the-move/)&nbsp;by Jennifer Brown ([Modern Girls](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780451477125)). It's the next installment in our partnership with Grub Street, and it'll definitely make you want to get off the couch and out on the trail, even if it is pitch dark out there.
<br>
<br>Thanks for reading,
