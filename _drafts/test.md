description: "This is a description. It could be rather long. Where does it show up? I don't know. \nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take  the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to  be listening, so she went on again: 'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is  it twelve? I&mdash;'\n\n'Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; 'I never could abide figures!'  And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of  lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of  every line."
