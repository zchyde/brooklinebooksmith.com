This November we will arrive at the end of the most contentious presidential election since [1800.](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/burr-slays-hamilton-in-duel) In the spirit of democracy I polled booksellers and book lovers from all over the country and asked, "What book(s) are you most thankful for?"

These titles got the popular vote:

Harry Potter series

Book Thief

Fire in the Heart

Wuthering Heights

Let Us Now Praise Famous Men

Franny & Zoey

Little Women

A Thousand Splendid Suns

Great Gatsby

The Glass Castle

Snow Falling On Cedars

The Outsiders

Anne of Green Gables

The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks

Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao

Blood Meridian

To The Lighthouse

The Jessica Darling series

Mrs. Dalloway

Up In The Old Hotel

Howard's End

Jane Eyre

A Confederacy of Dunces

Don Quixote

James and the Giant Peach

The Little Prince

The Voyage of the Basset

thankfully from now on we can focus on what we can all agree on â€“ good books.
