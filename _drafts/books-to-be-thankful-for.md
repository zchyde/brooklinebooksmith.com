It is no surprise that we are book lovers here at the 'smith. &nbsp; Books can transport us, can inspire us, and can change us.&nbsp; These are books that we don't just *like* but **LOVE.&nbsp;**They are books we are truly grateful for.&nbsp; With Thanksgiving around the bend (and in the spirit of democracy) I polled booksellers and book lovers from all over the country and asked, "What book(s) are you most thankful for?"

It comes as no surprise that **Harry Potter is the book for which folks are most thankful**.&nbsp; For some, the series started a fire.&nbsp; For others, the series provided a safe space during tumultuous times.&nbsp;

<br>The Harry Potter series is a unique experience for all.&nbsp; For myself it was a journey over time -- I grew as Harry grew.&nbsp; And as things got darker in the world around me things got dark at Hogwarts, too.&nbsp; All along, however,&nbsp; I knew that if they could make it I could, too.&nbsp; Rowling's epic series changed the world of literature and we are all grateful.

Many of the books people expressed gratitude for were ones from their childhood.&nbsp; It makes sense -- a kid's perspective of the world can change in an instant and be changed forever.&nbsp; These books expressed to us a new way of seeing the world.&nbsp; Levine's Ella Enchanted taught a young woman about saving herself. Eric Carle's The Very Hungry Caterpillar inspired one bookseller to become an illustrator.&nbsp; The Outsiders showed me the dark truth about being 'cool'.&nbsp; *A Wrinkle in Time* proved to one young man that he was never too young or too old to fight.
