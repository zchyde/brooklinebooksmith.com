It's November.&nbsp; While there are some things that we can't seem to agree on there's one thing that's universally true -- we love books.

We love books old and new and we are so thankful for them and for what they have brought into our lives.&nbsp; Books show us who we are before we can even see it for ourselves.&nbsp;
