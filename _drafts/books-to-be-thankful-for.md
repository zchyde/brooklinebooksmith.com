This November we will arrive at the end of the most contentious presidential election since [1800.](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/burr-slays-hamilton-in-duel) In the spirit of democracy I polled booksellers and book lovers from all over the country and asked, "What book(s) are you most thankful for?"

These titles got the popular vote:

ella enchanted

hp

book thief

fire in the heart

wuthering heights

bunnicula

let us now praise famous men

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

thankfully from now on we can focus on what we can all agree on -- good books.
