&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; April is Earth Month – with one certain date, April 22, set aside for special eco-celebrations.&nbsp; It’s an important time of year to explore various conservation initiatives and environmental concerns, such as Hydraulic Fracturing, better known as "Fracking.”&nbsp; The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines fracking as “the injection of fluid into shale beds at high pressure in order to free up petroleum resources (such as oil or natural gas).”&nbsp; For further investigations into this hot eco-topic, check out some of the books listed below and then come on in to Booksmith and grab one, reserve a copy on the phone, or [shop online](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/site)!
