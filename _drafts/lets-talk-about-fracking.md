April is Earth Month – with one certain day reserved for celebrating, Earth Day, on the 22nd.&nbsp; It’s an important time of year to explore various conservation initiatives and environmental concerns, such as Hydraulic Fracturing better known as Fracking.&nbsp; The Merriam-Webster defines fracking as “the injection of fluid into shale beds at high pressure in order to free up petroleum resources (such as oil or natural gas).”&nbsp; For further investigations into this hot eco-topic, check out some of the books listed below and then come on in to Booksmith and grab one, reserve a copy on the phone, or [shop online!](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/site)
