If you spend time in our Children's Section you know that we will send you home with a stack of books as tall as you are if we are given the chance.
<br>We figured that you see our names (Alex, Amy, Clarissa, and India) enough on the shelf talkers that crowd our beloved shelves, so for Children's Book week 2016 we asked all the OTHER bookstore folks for their favorite children's books!
