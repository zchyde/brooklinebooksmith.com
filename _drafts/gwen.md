Ever judged a book by its cover?
<br>They say not to do such a thing but everyone does -- so much so that dozens of minds come together to design a cover that will entice a reader to pick up a tome and to investigate it further.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

Judging a book by its cover is easy, and Haruki Murakami's newest softcover editons, designed by John Gall, have gotten a lot of judgement.
<br>
<br>Chip Kidd and John Gall have been designing the covers for Murakami's brilliant books since the 90s and have experimented with many different styles.&nbsp; Most motable are the mosaic japanese ephemera that has graced the covers of Murakami's mind bending novels since the 90s.
<br>
<br>Recently all of Murakami's titles, published by Vintage, have been redesigned opting for a very vibrant look.

These colorful covers seem unrelated but, upon closer investigation, one will find that these covers are in fact closer to Murakami's style than any to come before.&nbsp; Each title is seemingly unimportant but when you look closer you'll find that the common lines and shapes come together to form a puzzle.&nbsp; The mystery of it all is very Murakami.

John Gall speaks about the book covers saying, "I wanted the covers to be both bold and quiet at the same time. Colorful and full in a contemporary Japanese culture kind of way, yet with a deeper mysterious resonance."
<br>&nbsp;

Murakami states, "Writing a novel lets me intentionally dream while I’m still awake. I can continue yesterday’s dream today, something you can’t normally do in everyday life...I think people who share my dreams can enjoy reading my novels"
<br>

Look out for Murakami's new non-foction title coming this fall
