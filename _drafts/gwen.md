"For me, writing a novel is like having a dream. Writing a novel lets me intentionally dream while I’m still awake. I can continue yesterday’s dream today, something you can’t normally do in everyday life. It’s also a way of descending deep into my own consciousness." -- Haurki Murakami

"I think people who share my dreams can enjoy reading my novels. And that’s a wonderful thing."

Jacket designers Chip Kidd and John Gall
