Ever judged a book by its cover?
<br>They say not to do such a thing but everyone does.

Artists challenge themselves to design covers that will entice and inspire readers everywhere – all the while attempting to capture the essence of the book itself.&nbsp;

Chip Kidd and John Gall have taken on the considerable challenge of designing covers for world famous Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami's mind-bending books – and they've been doing it since the late 80s. They've both been hailed for their unique mosaic creations made from vintage Japanese ephemera and prints like this one:

In an [interview](http://www.harukimurakami.com/resource_category/q_and_a)&nbsp;designer John Gall reveals the inspiration for the cover came from piecing together some of Murakami's recurring themes and images – running water, disappearing women, random holes in the ground, and music.&nbsp;

<br>Murakami's titles have since been redesigned with a very different look.&nbsp;

This colorful cover seems insignificant but, upon closer investigation, you can see that random lines and shapes come together to form a puzzle. &nbsp;

> John Gall speaks about the book covers saying, "I wanted the covers to be both bold and quiet at the same time. Colorful and full…yet with a deeper mysterious resonance."

The seemingly mundane reveals itself to be more complicated and very connected – a singular truth that can be found in every Murakami novel. &nbsp;

They overcame the challenge once again and designed covers that are both appealing and reflective of the author's style.&nbsp;

Murakami says, "Writing a novel lets me intentionally dream while I’m still awake. I can continue yesterday’s dream today, something you can’t normally do in everyday life…I think people who share my dreams can enjoy reading my novels"

If that doesn't tell you what you need to know about Murakami's incredible books, well, I don't know what will.&nbsp;

Look out for Murakami's new collection of essays coming this fall
