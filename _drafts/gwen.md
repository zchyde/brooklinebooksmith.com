It's Fall. We are all done traveling to the shore and sleeping under the stars – but, that doesn't mean the adventure has to end. Here are a few novels that came out this Summer, but will breathe life into you as the leaves settle their final debts.

<br>*[The Underground Railroad](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780385542364)* by Colson Whitehead

Colson Whitehead's *<u>The Underground Railroad</u>* tells a brutal tale of America - but not the one we know. Whitehead's alternative history sees Civil War-era slaves fleeing north on trains hidden beneath the earth.

As a child I learned the infamous railroad was not made up of steel rails or heavy ties but rather lit homes and shabby rides. Whitehead's novel blends the literal and the imagined to create an escape network made up of all the danger, dead ends and uncertainty of the historical underground railroad. This author is not one to rest on novelty - his writing recaptures the narrative, broadening its implications while gripping the audience for a terrifying adventure.

Not quite convinced?*The New York Times* wrote a great [review](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/books/review/colson-whitehead-underground-railroad.html?_r=0) stating,

> "Whitehead’s imagination, unconstrained by stubborn facts, takes the novel to new places in the narrative of slavery…"
> <br>&nbsp;

You won't regret picking up this gem.

*[Another Brooklyn](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062359988)* by Jacqueline Woodson

> "I know now that what is tragic isn't the moment. It is the memory."

This novel is on fire.&nbsp; I don't mean a spontaneous, flailing fire pushed around by the oxygen that feeds it but a blazing, controlled burn.&nbsp; <u>Another Brooklyn</u>&nbsp;feeds off the strangeness of coming of age and the searing pain that comes with remembering it.&nbsp; <u>Another Brooklyn</u> revisits 1970s Brooklyn, NY and focuses on a group of four girls finding their way into adulthood.&nbsp; The novel recounts the memories of long forgotten times in a place full of wonder and danger.&nbsp; Woodson's lyricism is sharp and intoxicating.&nbsp; <u>Another Brooklyn</u> is a book that will take you back.
