Ever judge a book by its cover?
<br>They say not to do such a thing but everyone does.

Artists and designers are constantly challenging themselves to create covers that will entice and inspire readers everywhere – all the while attempting to capture the essence of the book itself.

Since the late 80s Chip Kidd and John Gall have taken on the considerable challenge of designing covers for the books world famous Japanese novelist [Haruki Murakami](http://www.harukimurakami.com/). They've been hailed for their unique mosaic creations made from vintage Japanese ephemera and prints like this one:

In an [interview](http://www.harukimurakami.com/resource_category/q_and_a)&nbsp;designer John Gall reveals that the inspiration for the cover came from (literally) piecing together some of Murakami's recurring themes and images – running water, disappearing women, random holes in the ground, and music.

<br>John Gall has since redesigned Murakami's paperback titles with a very different look.

The colorful cover seems insignificant but, upon closer investigation, you can see that random lines and shapes come together in the form of a geometric puzzle.

John Gall [speaks about](http://www.harukimurakami.com/resource_category/q_and_a) the book cover design stating

> "I wanted the covers to be both bold and quiet at the same time. Colorful and full…yet with a deeper mysterious resonance."

The seemingly mundane reveals itself to be more complicated and very connected. &nbsp;This is a singular truth reflected in every Murakami novel. &nbsp;The connection between the plain and the fantastic is a subtle and always critical part of Murakami's storytelling.

Gall overcame the epic challenge and once again designed covers that are both appealing and reflective of the author's dreamlike style.

On his writing Murakami [says](http://www.harukimurakami.com/resource_category/q_and_a/questions-for-haruki-murakami-about-kafka-on-the-shore),

> "Writing a novel lets me intentionally dream while I’m still awake. I can continue yesterday’s dream today, something you can’t normally do in everyday life…I think people who share my dreams can enjoy reading my novels"

If that doesn't tell you what you need to know about Murakami's incredible books, well, I don't know what will.

Look out for Murakami's new collection of essays coming this Fall.
