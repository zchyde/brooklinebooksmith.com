<br>[The Underground Railroad](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780385542364) by Colson Whitehead

Colson Whitehead's <u>The Underground Railroad</u> retells the cruel and brutal history of America that we all know.&nbsp; Whitehead recaptures the narrative and broadens its implications all the while gripping his audience on the most terrifying adventure.

As a child I imagined the underground railroad as literal rows of silvery tracks that lead North.&nbsp; I realized the railroad was not made up of steel rails or heavy ties but rather lit homes and shabby rides.&nbsp; Colson Whitehead's novel blends the literal and the imagined to create a real underground railroad made up of all the danger, dead ends and uncertainty of the underground railroad we know.&nbsp; This novel is at once a thrilling adventure and a poignant commentary.

The New York Times wrote a great [review](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/books/review/colson-whitehead-underground-railroad.html?_r=0)of this book stating,

> "Whitehead’s imagination, unconstrained by stubborn facts, takes the novel to new places in the narrative of slavery…"

This novel is timeless – literally.

[Another Brooklyn](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062359988) by Jacqueline Woodson

> "I know now that what is tragic isn't the moment. It is the memory."

This novel is on fire.&nbsp; It is not a spontaneous, flailing fire pushed around by the oxygen that feeds it but a blazing, controlled burn breathing in its life force.&nbsp; <u>Another Brooklyn</u>'s life force is memory.&nbsp; It feeds off the tragedy of coming of age and the searing pain that comes with remembering it.&nbsp; <u>Another Brooklyn</u> revisits 1970s Brooklyn and focuses on a group of friends finding their way into adulthood.&nbsp; The group is made up of a handful of girls living in a place full of wonder and danger.&nbsp; Woodson's lyricism is intoxicating and exact.&nbsp;
