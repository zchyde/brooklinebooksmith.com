Without preamble, here are some books your family might like to read this month.

***Be Who You Are***by Todd Parr--Parr's books have always been simple, bold, bright messages of care and acceptance. His brand new book is no different--and if you are three, or the parent of a three-year-old, or simply a person feeling shaky, you're equally likely to take solace in its gentle reminders.

*Maybe Something Beautiful: How Art Transformed a Neighborhood* by F. Isabel Campoy, Theresa Howell, Rafael Lopez--This true story reminds us that every hand is able to build, and that creativity and ownership and cooperation can change ugly things into something lovely.

*The Runaway Bunny* by Margaret Wise Brown--Let your little bunny know that you are their safety and their home.

*Big Bob, Little Bob* by James Howe--This is a lovely new book that tackles how kids react to gender norms--how to be okay with yourself, and okay with other people, and how to be a staunch defender when someone decides that different isn't okay.

*Miss Rumphius* by Barbara Cooney
