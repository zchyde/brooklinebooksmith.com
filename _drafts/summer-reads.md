Emma Cline's novel The Girls is already a smash hit. &nbsp;Set in the summer of love Cline's narrative follows a young girl as she finds her place.&nbsp; *The Girls* is as gritty and violent as it is vibrant and true.&nbsp; Cline masterfully designs scenes and characters and turns them into effortless depictions of things all girls can relate to.&nbsp; As the main character is seeking acceptance, is overwhelmed by curiosity, and is overcome with obsession the novel comes to a grizzly head.

Deborah Levy is well known for her novel Swimming Home which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize in 2012. &nbsp;This time she takes her audience to white beaches of southern Spain. &nbsp; The hot sands and cool waters look tantalizing – but their truth is devastating. &nbsp;Levy's novel exposes things both beautiful and strange all the while exploring themes of exile, desire, and total abandon – it's intoxicating.
