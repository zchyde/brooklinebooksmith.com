Rumaan Alam's debut novel is the perfect read for a long day at the beach.&nbsp; It is the epitome of the season – What's summer for if not for catching up with old friends, sharing secrets under the stars, and growing (whether together or apart). Alam deftly describes the nature of a long friendship between two women from their coming of age to their adult lives. &nbsp;The women grow and change all the while Alam annotates the intricacies of maintaining friendships over time and distance.&nbsp;

Deborah Levy is well known for her novel Swimming Home which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize in 2012. &nbsp;This time she takes her audience to white beaches of southern Spain. &nbsp; The hot sands and cool waters look tantalizing -- but their truth is devastating. &nbsp;Levy's novel exposes things both beautiful and strange all the while exploring themes of exile, desire, and total abandon -- it's intoxicating.
