Rumaan Alam's debut novel is the perfect read for a long day at the beach.  Set in glittering Manhattan, *Rich and Pretty* follows the lives of two women from their coming of age into their adult lives.  As the characters grow and change Alam annotates the intricacies of maintaining friendships over time and distance. Mr. Alam's effortless dialogue between the two women is uncanny – you can hear him discuss this and more in his interview with [NPR.](http://www.npr.org/2016/06/12/481750650/-rich-and-pretty-author-rumaan-alam-captures-lives-very-different-from-his-own)

*Rich and Pretty* is the epitome of a summer book – what's summer for if not for catching up with old friends, sharing secrets under the stars, and growing (whether together or apart)?

Emma Cline's debut novel *The Girls* is already a hit.  Set in the Summer of Love, Cline's narrative follows a young girl as she finds her place. Our protagonist is seeking acceptance, is overwhelmed by curiosity, and is overcome with obsession – all themes that Cline effortlessly weaves in to her increasingly dark plot. *The Girls* is gritty and vibrant.  Read more about *The Girls* and its inspiration at the [New York Times Book Review](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/05/books/review/the-girls-by-emma-cline.html?_r=0)

Deborah Levy is well known for her novel *Swimming Home* which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize in 2012.  This time she takes her audience to white beaches of southern Spain.   The hot sands and cool waters look tantalizing – but their truth is devastating.  Levy's novel exposes things both beautiful and strange all the while exploring themes of exile, desire, and total abandon – it's intoxicating.

Jessi Klein – well known for her work with comedian Amy Schumer – writes a side-splitting autobiography in *You'll Grow Out Of It*.  Klein hilariously addresses the ins and outs of being an outsider with this collection of admissions and mistakes.  Klein asks the question, "What becomes of a tomboy who grows up?" with wit and grace. Her answer to this question is so funny because it's true.
