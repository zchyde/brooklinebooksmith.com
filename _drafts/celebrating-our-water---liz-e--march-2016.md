Celebrating Our Water -by Liz E.

In March we celebrate [World Water Day](http://www.unwater.org/worldwaterday) (March 22), a time to be thankful for our waterways (streams, ponds, lakes, rivers, bogs, estuaries, wetlands, and our oceans). It's also a time to remember how lucky many of us are to have clean, fresh drinking water, water for recreation, and picturesque water-centered landscapes to view. One might also say, everywhere we are, we're in a watershed. World Water Day finds its roots in the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. At that time, the U.N. recommended an international observance for water. The first celebration was in 1993, and each year there is a new theme. The 2016 theme is water and jobs. This water-inspired, eco-initiative reminds us to learn more about water issues, and to take eco-actions to protect this valuable natural resource.To properly celebrate World Water Day, let's explore some good books about water.

![](/uploads/versions/waterbabies---x----417-400x---.jpg)Learn about the young birds dwelling in the wetlands of North America in the beautiful book, *Water Babies*, by William Burt. Brilliant nature photographs, taken by Burt himself, illustrate the lives of these hard-to-observe--in-the-wild aviary babies. You'll travel to arctic Alaska and to Florida's cypress swamps and everywhere else in between.

![](/uploads/versions/outermosthouse---x----272-400x---.jpg)Called a core title, or contemporary classic in the ecology world, “spend” a year on Cape Cod with Henry Beston in *The Outermost House*. Full of daily details about one of the most coveted vacation spots in the U.S., you'll enjoy Beston's personal observations of this seaside ecosystem. Beston had decided to spend only 2 weeks living in the tiny house on the shore, but he loved the landscape's beauty and perplexity too much; he could not leave!

![](/uploads/versions/rivertown---x----265-400x---.jpg)Peter Hessler describes the two years he lived along China's Yangtze River in his book entitled *River Town*. Witnessing the political and cultural changes of Fuling, a town in China's Sichuan province, Hessler teaches us how the river's path both defines and reconstructs the life of this community.

![](/uploads/versions/swampwalkersjournal---x----265-400x---.jpg)One of my favorite books on the wonders of water is entitled *Swampwalker's Journal* by David M. Carroll. In this nature narrative, Carroll spends a year journeying through the wetlands, documenting what he finds along the way. He even illustrates the book with his own artwork, noticing the amazing details of the flora and fauna.
