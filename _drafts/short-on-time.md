I made a great discovery a while back and I can't really believe it took me as long as it did. Like any good Science Fiction and Fantasy lover, (and as the bookseller dedicated to that section ), I constantly haunt [Tor.com](http://www.tor.com/) (which, if you don't, you should start doing immediately). I had read many of the original short stories that are published there, a particular favorite being the [Log Goblin](http://www.tor.com/2015/12/09/the-log-goblin-brian-staveley/)[&nbsp;by Brian Staveley](__notset__)&nbsp;(who, incidentally, is going to be here on [March 24th](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/) ). I had also seen many of the articles talking about the short fiction that Tor.com publishes.&nbsp;

I started with [The Builders by Daniel Polanksy](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780765385307)&nbsp;and it just blew me away. I finished it in a sitting, and the whole time I was in awe of how quickly Polansky got right to the meat of the world, the characters, and the story. When you only have 226 pages I guess you wouldn't want to mess around.

The great storytelling wasn't the only thing I fell in love with. There was something invigorating in reading a short fantasy novel. It was a palate cleanser, a great way to gobble down a novel, a way to explore a new writer and new world without having to commit to a 500 page epic or series when life is running by me at a hectic pace.

I have since acquired almost all of the Tor.com short fiction works they have available. It is a delightful collection of diverse characters, worlds, and writing styles. Some authors that are known, and some that are unknowns.

Having my own collection is great, but as a bookseller one of my greatest joys is sharing all my new bookish obsessions with everyone I can get to listen! So I made some lists, chattered over exuberantly to the right people, and now we are going to have a little section dedicated to Tor.com short fictions in the Science Fiction and Fantasy section!

Titles are still rolling in so here is a virtual version of what the section will have:

I haven't cared about animals this much since Watership Down." Delilah S. Dawson
