I made a great discovery a while back and I can't really believe it took me as long as it did. Like any good Science Fiction and Fantasy lover, (and as the bookseller dedicated to that section ), I constantly haunt [Tor.com](http://www.tor.com/) (which, if you don't, you should start doing immediately). I had read many of the original short stories that are published there, a particular favorite being the [Log Goblin](http://www.tor.com/2015/12/09/the-log-goblin-brian-staveley/)[&nbsp;by Brian Staveley](__notset__)&nbsp;(who, incidentally, is going to be here on [March 24th](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/) ). I had also seen many of the articles talking about the novellas that Tor.com publishes.&nbsp;

I started with [The Builders by Daniel Polanksy](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780765385307)&nbsp;and it just blew me away. I finished it in a sitting, and the whole time I was in awe of how quickly Polansky got right to the meat of the world, the characters, and the story. When you only have 226 pages I guess you wouldn't want to mess around.

The great storytelling wasn't the only thing I fell in love with. There was something invigorating in reading a short fantasy novel. It was a palate cleanser, a great way to gobble down a novel, a way to explore a new writer and new world without having to commit to a 500 page epic or series when life is running by me at a hectic pace.

I have since acquired almost all of the Tor.com novellas works they have available. It is a delightful collection of diverse characters, worlds, and writing styles. Some authors that are known, and some that are unknowns.

Having my own collection is great, but as a bookseller one of my greatest joys is sharing all my new bookish obsessions with everyone I can get to listen! So I made some lists, chattered over exuberantly to the right people, and now we are going to have a little section dedicated to Tor.com novellas in the Science Fiction and Fantasy section!

Titles are still rolling in but here is a sneak peak of some of my favorites so far:

![](/uploads/versions/9780765385307---x----250-400x---.jpg)[The Builders by Daniel Polanksy](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780765385307) - The quote on the cover really sums it up most eloquently, "A living, breathing world of vivid, winsome characters hellbent on their blaze of glory and as unforgiving as a runaway train carrying all your friends over a cliff. I haven't cared about animals this much since Watership Down." Delilah S. Dawson

![](/uploads/versions/binti---x----250-400x---.jpg)[Binti by Nnedi Okorafor](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780765385253) - and yet another great quote"Binti is a supreme read about a sexy, edgy Afropolitan in space. It's a wondrous combination of extra-terrestrial adventure and age-old African diplomacy. Unforgettable " Wanuri Kahiu

![](/uploads/versions/ballad-of-black-tom---x----250-400x---.jpg)[Ballad of Black Tom by Victor LaValle](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780765387868) - Which is so great that Kevin R Free (from Night Vale) narrated the story for your [audio pleasure](http://www.tor.com/2016/03/11/just-try-to-escape-the-voice-of-kevin-r-free/)! Which we think is kind of awesome.

---![](/uploads/versions/forest-of-memory---x----250-400x---.jpg)[Forest of Memory by Mary Robinette Kowal](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780765387912) - The excerpt on [Tor.com](http://www.tor.com/2016/03/03/excerpts-forest-of-memory-mary-robinette-kowal/) gave me goosebumps and I can't wait to read more!
