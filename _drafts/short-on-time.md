I made a great discovery a while back and I can't really believe it took me as long as it did. Like any good Science Fiction/ Fantasy lover, (and as the bookseller dedicated to that section ), I constantly haunt [Tor.com](http://www.tor.com/) (which, if you don't, you should start doing immediately). I had read many of the original short stories that are published there,a particular favorite being the [Log Goblin](http://www.tor.com/2015/12/09/the-log-goblin-brian-staveley/)[&nbsp;by Brian Staveley](__notset__)&nbsp;(who incidentally is going to be here on March 24th )
