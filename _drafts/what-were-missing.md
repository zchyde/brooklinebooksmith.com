This last week, the children's bookselling team had the privilege of attending a meeting of the New England Children's Booksellers Advisory Council at the Boston offices of Little, Brown. We got a fabulous behind-the-scenes look at how cover designs come together, and sneak peaks of some tremendous upcoming books.&nbsp;

(These included: Grace Lin's WHEN THE SEA TURNED TO SILVER, a companion to her Newbery Honor-winning WHERE THE MOUNTAINS MEET THE MOON; Peter Brown's first middle grade novel, THE WILD ROBOT; Dan Santat's time-warping ARE WE THERE YET?; Sherman Alexie and Yuyi Morales's picture book THUNDER BOY JR.; and Ame Dyckman and Zachariah Ohora's picture book HORRIBLE BEAR!. I made at least–AT LEAST–one terrible noise of unbearable excitement while all these books were being shown to us. There is a limit on shame, and that limit is long passed by when someone hands you a copy of THE WILD ROBOT.)

When the conversation was turned over to the booksellers, one question that came up was a question that I think everyone who reads finds themselves running into: what's missing from the shelves? That's to say, of thousands of books that are published for children every year, of all the books that are carried by bookstores, libraries, and schools, who is still missing? What's still invisible? Which necessary stories have fallen out of vogue?

Booksellers have opinions and answers--it's kind of our job. Needless to say, everyone in the room could point to something that they wanted to see more of. Picture books with longer stories! Middle grade novels where no parents die! YA lesbians with happy endings! Middle grade lesbians, full stop! Narrative nonfiction for 8-12 year olds! Books featuring black characters that are not about slavery! (Oh! And one suggestion was more books like Holly Goldberg Sloan's heart-wrenching and wonderful COUNTING BY 7S, but featuring a male protagonist--I'd like to give a loud shout out for Leslie Connor's newly released ALL RISE FOR THE HONORABLE PERRY T. COOK.)

Sometimes not finding the book of your heart is due to an actual dearth of material--even if it's being written, maybe that story is not making it to print. Sometimes it's just that, in what is truly a boom in children's publishing, it's impossible for any reader to keep up with everything that's coming out. It can be very daunting to start looking for something, or even to know how. Our hope of course is always that the books&nbsp;*do*&nbsp;exist, and that we can help you find them.&nbsp;
