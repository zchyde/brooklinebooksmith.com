This last week, the children's bookselling team had the privilege of attending a meeting of the New England Children's Booksellers Advisory Council at the Boston offices of Little, Brown. We got a fabulous behind-the-scenes look at how cover designs come together, and sneak peaks of some tremendous upcoming books.&nbsp;

(These included: Grace Lin's WHEN THE SEA TURNED TO SILVER, a companion to her Newbery Honor-winning WHERE THE MOUNTAINS MEET THE MOON; Peter Brown's first middle grade novel, THE WILD ROBOT; Dan Santat's time-warping ARE WE THERE YET?; Sherman Alexie and Yuyi Morales's picture book THUNDER BOY JR.; and Ame Dyckman and Zachariah Ohora's picture book HORRIBLE BEAR!. I made at least--AT LEAST--one terrible noise of unbearable excitement while all these books were being shown to us. There is a limit on shame, and that limit is LONG PASSED BY when someone hands you a copy of THE WILD ROBOT.)
