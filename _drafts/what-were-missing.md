This last week, the children's bookselling team had the privilege of attending a meeting of the New England Children's Booksellers Advisory Council at the Boston offices of Little, Brown. We got a fabulous behind-the-scenes look at how cover designs come together, and sneak peaks of some tremendous upcoming books.&nbsp;

(These included: Grace Lin's WHEN THE SEA TURNED TO SILVER, a companion to her Newbery Honor-winning WHERE THE MOUNTAINS MEET THE MOON; Peter Brown's first middle grade novel, THE WILD ROBOT; Dan Santat's time-warping ARE WE THERE YET?; Sherman Alexie and Yuyi Morales's picture book THUNDER BOY JR.; and Ame Dyckman and Zachariah Ohora's picture book HORRIBLE BEAR!. I made at least–AT LEAST–one terrible noise of unbearable excitement while all these books were being shown to us. There is a limit on shame, and that limit is long passed by when someone hands you a copy of THE WILD ROBOT.)

When the conversation was turned over to the booksellers, one question that came up was a question that I think everyone who reads runs up against: where on the shelf is the kind of book *I'm*looking for? That's to say, of the thousands of books that are published for children every year, of all the books that are carried by bookstores, libraries, and schools, who is still missing? What's still invisible? Which necessary stories have fallen out of vogue, or have never been seen?

Booksellers (have you met one?) have opinions and answers. (You have probably noticed, if you have met one.) It is kind of our job. Certain traits, such as being opinionated and having answers, are key to the bookseller lifestyle. Needless to say, everyone in the room could point to something that they wanted to see more of. Picture books with longer stories! Middle grade novels where no parents die! YA lesbians with happy endings! Middle grade lesbians, full stop! Narrative nonfiction for 8-12 year olds! Books featuring black characters that are not about slavery!

(Side note: one suggestion was for more introspective middle grade books like Holly Goldberg Sloan's heart-wrenching and wonderful COUNTING BY 7S, but featuring a male protagonist--I'd like to give a loud shout out for Leslie Connor's newly released ALL RISE FOR THE HONORABLE PERRY T. COOK.)

Part of the joy of being in a bookstore, for me, is trying to pick through and find the one good thing that will satisfy the reading itch I'm feeling. And part of the joy in being a bookseller is in getting it right for someone else. Leaping in feet first can be frustrating--I too have wandered the shelves in libraries and bookstores unable to settle on anything, because I know what I want to feel, and I don't know how to find it.

Sometimes it's just that, in what is truly a boom in children's publishing, it's impossible for any reader to keep up with everything that's coming out. It's a *lot of books.&nbsp;*It can be daunting. It can be hard to know even how to start looking.&nbsp;

Sometimes what you care about in a book isn't what makes it onto the cover (even when the cover is beautiful)--the part that will be remembered decades later by you or your child is not the part someone else thought was most important. Sometimes not finding the book of your heart is due to an actual dearth of material--even if it's being written, maybe that story is not making it to print. No matter how many books we have, it seems inevitable that there will be gaps.&nbsp;

One of the great things about getting together in a room and talking about what we're missing, though, is to discover what we're not.&nbsp;
