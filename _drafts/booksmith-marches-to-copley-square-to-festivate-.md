![](/uploads/versions/bbf2016---x----800-523x---.jpg)"For had I bought a dinner, we should have eaten it tomorrow, and the pleasure would have been soon over, but should we live fifty years longer, we shall have the *Night Thoughts* to feast upon."
<br>- [James Lackington](http://lithub.com/the-man-who-invented-bookselling-as-we-know-it/), revolutionary 18th-century London bookseller who redefined what a bookstore could be, on spending his last half-crown on a book of poetry.
<br>
<br>Did you click that link? Can you believe that before Lackington, bookstores would buy up vast quantities of remaindered books and then *set fire to most of them*, in order to jack up the price?! We've come a long way, thank goodness. But books still burn bright every autumn in Copley Square!  And once again we are thrilled and honored to be the bookseller of choice for
<br>that wonderful fall tradition, the [Boston Book Festival.](https://bostonbookfest.org/) Come say hi in our pop-up store on the Square, and browse through the works on offer from the amazing lineup of authors appearing at this year's Festival, including: **Frank Gehry, Emma Donoghue, Maria Semple, Tom Perrotta, Jon Klassen,** oh why am I even bothering, just go see for yourself the [truly astonishing variety of talent](https://bostonbookfest.org/2016-festival/presenters/) this time around.
<br>
<br>I would love to stick around and chat some more, but it's been a crazy busy few days for yours truly, and I can tell that I'd just start rambling and get things mixed up, like this morning on the register when I asked the customer if they'd like a bag for their books, and they clearly said no, and so I flap-flap-flapped open a bag and slid their books in, and then
<br>"No, I said I don't need a bag."
<br>"Oh, jeez, my mind is working on some project ten miles from here, I'm only half here, sorry."
<br>"No, don't apologize. *You're* not the one who put a globe in the refrigerator."
<br>
<br>Thanks for reading,
