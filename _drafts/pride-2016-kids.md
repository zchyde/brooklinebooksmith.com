A great nonfiction resource is Jerome Pohlen's&nbsp;*[Gay and Lesbian History for Kids: The Century-Long Struggle for LGBT Rights.](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781613730829)&nbsp;*Accessible but rigorous history is interspersed with learning activities--and unlike a disappointing number of LGBT histories for all ages, this one remembers often overlooked transgender activists like Marsha P. Johnson.

For a simple, cheery introduction to Pride parades and Pride month celebrations, try Gayle E. Pitman and Kristyna Litten's Stonewall Award-winning picture book&nbsp;*This Day In June**.*
