*Olio* by Tyehimba Jess (Wave Books) is a poetic tribute to African American performance artists from the Civil War to World War I.&nbsp;

*Olio&nbsp;*is dedicated to the cast of African American performers during the period and gives life to those voices we cannot hear today.

Unique formatting, rhythmic syncopation, and imaginative interviews represent the tumultuous progression of blues and gospel music performed by African Americans.&nbsp;

Olio received much praise at this year's [Association of Writers and Writer's Programs](https://www.awpwriter.org/awp_conference/event_detail/6935) convention.&nbsp;

Jess sat on a panel of Black poets speaking about jazz and its influence on black poets young and old. &nbsp;

In an interview with Laura Swearingen-Steadwell for [The Conversant](http://theconversant.org/?p=7581)&nbsp;Jess discusses that history --

> The thing about black history in particular is itâ€™s been distorted and whitewashed in so many different ways, and I do not want to be a part of that process. So to the best of my ability I try to get an accurate fix on what happened. Then I work between the lines: between what happened, and the idea of what happened.

*Olio*&nbsp;immortalizes the African American history that is written between the lines. The collection works outside of the box in order to accurately portray what happened.&nbsp;

The collection is uniquely interactive. Perforated outsized pages can be removed to create new forms. &nbsp;They can be made into cylindrical shapes and M&ouml;bius strips that allow for the same poem to be read many different ways. &nbsp;This is reminiscent of the way African American artists reinvent traditions in order to advance the black narrative. &nbsp;

Tyehimba Jess made himself very clear in his writing. &nbsp;The collection does not mince words and it is often as blunt as it is poetic. &nbsp;The reader can hear and feel the turmoil, even interact with it, bringing back to life the dozens of performers that were previously lost to a whitewashed history.&nbsp;

One reviewer found Jess' method to be successful in reinventing black stories as they were always meant to be.&nbsp;

> What becomes clear in the reading of this book is that Jess, though an author who has a voice that cannot be mistaken, acts more as a gentle tour guide through a period of black artistry that is often represented differently than it is here...In walking away from reading Olio, history has been reclaimed and redefined. It is, beyond a book of poems, an encyclopedia of black stories, told as we most want to see them told.
