*[Olio](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781940696201)* by Tyehimba Jess ([Wave Books](http://www.wavepoetry.com/)) is a poetic tribute to African American performance artists from the Civil War to World War I. Most of their performances were never recorded and this collection gives life to those voices we cannot hear today. &nbsp;Unique formatting, precise rhythm, and imaginative interviews represent the tumultuous progression of music performed by African Americans as well as the attempts to minstrelize them.&nbsp;

Olio received much praise at this year's [Association of Writers and Writer's Programs](https://www.awpwriter.org/awp_conference/event_detail/6935) convention.

Jess sat on a panel about jazz history and its influence Black poets young and old.

In an interview with Laura Swearingen-Steadwell for [The Conversant](http://theconversant.org/?p=7581)&nbsp;Jess discussed that history

> The thing about black history in particular is it’s been distorted and whitewashed in so many different ways, and I do not want to be a part of that process. So to the best of my ability I try to get an accurate fix on what happened. Then I work between the lines: between what happened, and the idea of what happened.

*Olio*&nbsp;immortalizes the African American history that is written between the lines.

The collection works outside of the box in order to accurately portray what happened. Syncopated sonnets with biographical facts is not the only way&nbsp;*Olio*&nbsp;is unique -- it is also interactive.

Perforated outsized pages can be removed to create new poems.

They can be made into cylindrical shapes and M&ouml;bius strips that allow for the same poem to be read many different ways – reminiscent of the way African American artists reinvent their traditions and advance their narrative. &nbsp;

Tyehimba Jess does not mince words and the collection is often as blunt as it is poetic.

The reader can hear and feel the turmoil -- even interact with it -- bringing back to life the dozens of performers that were previously lost to a whitewashed history.&nbsp;

Hanif Willis-Abdurraqi of&nbsp;[*The Rumpus*](http://therumpus.net/) found Jess' method to be successful in reinventing black stories as they were always meant to be

> What becomes clear in the reading of this book is that Jess, though an author who has a voice that cannot be mistaken, acts more as a gentle tour guide through a period of black artistry that is often represented differently than it is here…In walking away from reading Olio, history has been reclaimed and redefined. It is, beyond a book of poems, an encyclopedia of black stories, told as we most want to see them told.

*Olio&nbsp;*is dedicated to these performers:

Fisk Jubilee singers, Scott Joplin, Sissiereta Jones, Edmonia Lewis (the sculptor), Henry Box Brown, Bert Williams & George Walker, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Booker T. Washington, Blind Boon and Blind Tom

Tyehimba Jess' *Olio&nbsp;*is a medley that I won't be getting out of my head any time soon. Dedicated to the performers of the past this is an essential read for artists of the present and the future.&nbsp;
