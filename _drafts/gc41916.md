*Olio* by Tyehimba Jess published by Wave Books is a tome dedicated to the cast of african american performers during the period in America.

Jess uses &nbsp;powerful forms to create this palimpsestic anthology of african american performance art from the Civil War to World War I.

Jess creatively chronicles the history of african american performance from blues to gospel.

*Olio&nbsp;*reflects on the musicality of african american history and uses rhythm and form to bring to life the sounds of those integral performers of the past that helped shape music we know today â€“ from jazz and blues to gospel and spoken word.

Tight rhytym and syntax to divulge the rich histories of individuals essential to the formation of modern music.

with focus on biography and history with ambitious forms. &nbsp;

Jess combats the potential for minstrelization of african american performers before technology could capture their sound. &nbsp;&nbsp;
