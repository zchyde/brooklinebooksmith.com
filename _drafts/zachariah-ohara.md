What I find appealing about children's picture books is that as an adult they take me roughly two minutes to read. Lets say I devoted an entire lunch break to reading picture books. I could bang out 30 books! 30! Extrapolate that out over the course of a work week and that's … hold on I have to take my shoes off for this one … a lot of books! Imagine if I were to go to a party and strike up a conversation with a person of affluence. *Did you hear? Carl read 150 books last week! The brain on that guy! He should be mayor!&nbsp;*A crowd would gather around me.*&nbsp;Tell us which one was your favorite, old sport!&nbsp;*I'd swish my cocktail around in my sippy cup and tell them about how [*My Cousin Momo*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780803740112) brought up some interesting points on how as a society we're so quick to make sweeping generalizations based on personal appearances and how on a glo-*that's great, Carl, but have you tried this p&acirc;t&eacute;? I hear the meat was minced less than hour ago!*

Golly, do I hate [p&acirc;t&eacute;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pâté).

But I do love *My Cousin Momo&nbsp;*and its creator, [Zachariah OHora](http://www.zohora.com), could probably get me to not hate p&acirc;t&eacute;.&nbsp;

Momo is a flying squirrel who marches to the beat of his own drum. Rather than doing what all the other squirrels do, namely play acorn ping-pong, he's much more interested in squirrel counterculture. He rocks a sweet vintage 35mm camera and wears a headband un-inronically. As far as squirrels go, he's fresher than farm stand produce. So do the other squirrels come to accept Momo's freshness? Do they realized how narrow their world-views are on a geo-political scale? Especially when considering that even within their own squirrel community there are over 250 different types of squirrel species? Do they eventually come to accept Momo's insatiable appetite for muffins? Better muffins than p&acirc;t&eacute;*.&nbsp;*

Once you're done with My Cousin Momo, be sure to check out [*Wolfie The Bunny*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316226141) and [*Horrible Bear!*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316282833), both are illustrated by OHora and written by the equally wonderful&nbsp;[Ame Dyckman](http://www.amedyckman.com/home.html). In fact, you really should just buy everything they create.&nbsp;
