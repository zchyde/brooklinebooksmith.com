A very beautiful book has been making its way through the children's section. Lauren Wolk's middle grade debut, WOLF HOLLOW, is a forboding and contemplative piece of historical fiction set in the rural United States during World War II. Everyone is touched by that. The town, however, is peaceful enough, until the arrival of Betty [NAME], a charmer and a vicious bully whose stay with her grandparents is never fully explained. The story is told by [DARN GIRL NAME], first as a target of Betty's violence and then as the only voice raised to protect a friend: the wordless, rifle-bearing wanderer who is blamed when Betty disappears.

There are several points at which the book almost unbearably good at complicated darkness. [NAME'S] private feelings and her whole sense of rightness and safety collide over and over with the fresh points of conflict, violence, and distrust that are inflicted on her peaceful life.&nbsp;

How do you make up the difference between the fear and anger you feel towards a terrible bully, and the cold terror of knowing that bully is in danger that's even worse than she deserves?

How do you hold onto a gut feeling someone is good when there aren't enough facts to protect you from everyone else's belief that he's a monster?
<br>
<br>How do you remain innocent and clearheaded and unafraid when someone walks out of a war and tells you everything he's seen?

Without ruining a second of the plot, let me say that this book gives you the truth from page one about what kind of story it is. It's a quick read, but [NAME] tells it like she's slowly setting something down that hurts to carry. She's so honest about it that I don't feel like it's a spoiler to say that this book doesn't end in laughter and a parade.

But it's a good ending.In my post last Monday, I quoted former Ambassador for Children's Literature Kate DiCamillo in her 2008 Newbery acceptance speech, where she talks about the fact of darkness in the lives of children, and the value in acknowledging that in their books. I kept thinking of that while I read this book.
