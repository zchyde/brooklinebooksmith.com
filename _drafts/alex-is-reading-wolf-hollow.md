A beautiful book has been making its way through the children's section. Lauren Wolk's middle grade debut, WOLF HOLLOW, is a foreboding and contemplative piece of historical fiction set in rural Pennsylvania during World War II. Everyone is touched by the war, but Annabelle, the book's young narrator, knows the town itself as a safe and peaceful place–until the arrival of one fourteen-year-old girl.

Betty Glengarry is a charmer of grown-ups and a vicious bully towards her fellow children. Her stay with her grandparents is spoken of sideways, and never fully explained. Annabelle, the first target of Betty's violence, is silent at first; but the situation escalates frighteningly and fast. When Betty disappears, Annabelle finds that she is the one person who can protect the wordless, wandering, and rifle-bearing veteran suspected of kidnapping her. She finds, as well, that she may be her cruel tormentor's only hope of getting home.

There are several points at which the book almost unbearably good at complicated darkness. Annabelle's private feelings and her whole sense of rightness and safety collide over and over with the fresh points of conflict, violence, and distrust that are inflicted on her peaceful life. Betty Glengarry is truly terrifying, a life-sized villain without any remorse, but when her life is at risk, Annabelle's fear *for* her runs alongside.

Annabelle is an honest narrator, so it doesn't feel like a spoiler to say that this book doesn't end in laughter and a parade. Now, you really need to read it for yourself to determine whether you think it's a good ending, or the right ending. But I'd say strongly that you shouldn't turn away from it for having a sad ending.

In my post last Monday, I quoted former Ambassador for Children's Literature Kate DiCamillo in her 2008 Newbery acceptance speech, where she talks about the fact of darkness in the lives of children, and the value in acknowledging that in their books. I kept thinking of that while I read this book.

It's easy as a bookseller (and I suspect as a parent) to shy away from difficult stories for children, no matter how much we might have liked them ourselves. But I think a flat out ban is an awful mistake, especially when I remember myself as a kid. I didn't just like kid tragedies, I *devoured* them. Some of my most wretchedly torn-up paperbacks were the classically devastating *Bridge to Terabithia* and Betsy Byars's *The Pinballs.*I sobbed my way several times through Rachel Anderson's *The Bus People.*(This is an extremely out of print short story collection about the private lives of passengers on a school bus for disabled students. I have no idea how it would read to me now, but at eleven, I was repeatedly, thoroughly devastated.) Raymond Brigg's picture book enemy of happiness, *The Snowman*, goes through a whole awesome night of parties and Santa Claus and learning about kitchen appliances before the sun comes up and he melts, out of existence, FOREVER.

(Admission: this is one of those cases where I do prefer the movie. The movie has that music, the music that will make your throat catch before you even remember where you know it from.)

Robert Cormier's brutally nihilistic novels shaped young adult fiction alongside Lurlene McDaniel's sappy heartbreakers. (If you think *The Fault in Our Stars* made the dying teen girl a YA superstar, hearken to Lurlene.) Patrick Ness's *A Monster Calls*is about catharsis and acceptance and grief, and you will grieve cathartically until your stomach hurts.

*Harriet the Spy* turns out all right, but her entire book is about finding out that she's been kind of a jerk this whole time. Never once do the characters in Karen Hesse's *Out of the Dust* actually get out of the dust. Lemony Snicket capitalizes on horrible endings for TWELVE VOLUMES in A Series of Unfortunate Events. *Charlotte's Web*does not even need explaining. More recently, Kathi Appelt's *Maybe a Fox*and Gary Schmidt's *Orbiting Jupiter* steadfastly refuse to end on a, you know, maybe a positive note! And not all of these novels will work for everyone, because that is how reading is, but–here is the thing–they do, overall, work. Kids crave difficult things. Sometimes we all crave difficult things–difficult things that we know *we* will survive, even if not all the characters will.

Here's the thing: all books need a good ending. Not all good endings are happy, and not all happy endings are good. Sometimes what we need at the end is a story that still aches at the back of our hearts, years later, when we've grown up.
