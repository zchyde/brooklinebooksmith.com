A very beautiful book has been making its way through the children's section. Lauren Wolk's middle grade debut, WOLF HOLLOW, is a forboding and contemplative piece of historical fiction set in the rural United States during World War II. Everyone is touched by that. The town, however, is peaceful enough, until the arrival of Betty [NAME], a charmer and a vicious bully whose stay with her grandparents is never fully explained. The story is told by [DARN GIRL NAME], first as a target of Betty's violence and then as the only voice raised to protect the wordless, rifle-bearing wanderer who is blamed when Betty disappears.

Without ruining a second of the plot, let me say that this book does not lie from page one about how happily it ends. It does not end happily.

In my post last Monday, I quoted former Ambassador for Children's Literature Kate DiCamillo in her 2008 Newbery acceptance speech, where she talks about the fact of darkness in the lives of children, and the value in acknowledging that in their books. I kept thinking of that while I read this book. There are several points at which it's almost unbearably good at complicated darkness. [NAME'S] private feelings and her whole sense of rightness and safety, collide with the conflicting, violent, and untrustworthy things that are suddenly being inflicted on her peaceful life.&nbsp;

How do you make up the difference between the fear and anger you feel towards a terrible bully, and the cold terror of knowing that bully is in danger that's even worse than she deserves?

How do you hold onto a gut feeling someone is good when there aren't enough facts to protect you from everyone else's belief that he's a monster?

<br>How do you remain innocent and clearheaded and unafraid when someone walks out of a war and tells you everything he's seen?
