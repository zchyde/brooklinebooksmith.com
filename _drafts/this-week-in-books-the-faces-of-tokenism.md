The past few weeks have given us the mass media convulsions of [#OscarsSoWhite](https://twitter.com/hashtag/oscarssowhite), [Chris Rock's scathing awards hosting performance](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-awards-oscars-show-idUSKCN0W2071) and [this really wonderful feature by the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/24/arts/hollywood-diversity-inclusion.html?_r=0) on the experiences of non-white/straight/male Hollywood denizens - all part of the emergent national dialogue on racism. The publishing world is feeling similar seismic shock following the first-ever industry-wide diversity survey by Lee & Low - take a second and [check out these pie charts](http://blog.leeandlow.com/2016/01/26/where-is-the-diversity-in-publishing-the-2015-diversity-baseline-survey-results/). L&L deserve major props for the scope of their coverage - over the course of 2015 they include data from 8 review journals and 34 publishers, and record identity profiles which are often left out similar investigations. We see listings for indigenous groups and multiracial minorities; trans, intersex and gender nonconforming individuals; asexuals, pansexuals & bisexuals; as well as people with disabilities - all in addition to better recognized but still drastically underrepresented minorities. The average publishing employee is more likely to be a woman than a man, but otherwise the industry looks overwhelmingly like Hollywood - straight, white and cis.

In response to L&L's findings, Brooklyn Magazine's Molly Mcardle spoke with minority members of the publishing world about their experiences.&nbsp;

So where do we go from here? Mcardle closes *Brooklyn Mag*'s article with a line from Claire Vaye Watkins' infamous Tin House essay '[On Pandering](http://www.tinhouse.com/blog/41314/on-pandering.html)': "Let us burn this motherf\*\*\*ing system to the ground and build something better."
