Sometimes until someone else points it out, you really, really don't think about a thing as a genre. For example: a friend of mine is very into books about magical trees. This sounded very specific to me, fool that I was, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized it is, in fact, a well-explored and little-named pocket of fantasy writing. There's a fantastic wealth of books hiding there, too.

What counts? Oh, all kinds of things. Magical tree books may involve:

* human people turning into trees
* people who look like humans but have been trees all along
* humans with psychic connections to trees
* beings that look like trees and always have been trees but have also always been people.


They can also occasionally involve plants that aren't trees, but trees are the heartwood.\*

A tree, like natural objects, is morally neutral and also universal. Trees can, therefore, do pretty much anything they like once they get outfitted with preternatural powers and thrown into a story. Person-trees plant themselves, and tree-persons stride around your back yard, but you can't know until you've stepped into the shade whether you're about to get skin-scratching bloody horror or deep, peaceful enlightenment. There are no hard and fast rules–one of the great benefits to being a quietly occurring theme instead of a Known Genre is that there are fewer firmly accepted truths gnawing away at the invention of the authors writing it. Generally speaking, tree-person stories blur lines between human nature and the parts of nature we’re least able to share a language with.

Humans are slowed down. They see the world more fully, or they sleep through centuries. Plants are sped up. They gain speech, and motion that’s perceptible outside a time-lapse. They gain emotions–or the ability to express to our brief, inattentive selves the huge and haunting passions normally held in close silence below their bark. Somewhere in the middle, all kinds of incredibly creative stories happen.

Unfortunately, some of the best, most tree-ish stuff to happen in these books is absolutely on the other side of the spoiler line. So I'll bite my tongue, offer you this list, and invite you to a tradition as old Daphne, Merlin, and nearly as old as [the oldest trees](http://mentalfloss.com/article/29879/6-oldest-trees-world). It's a fine time of year to appreciate your trees.

1. **THE LORD OF THE RINGS by J.R.R. Tolkien** - The Ents are essential in tree literature, and also a reminder that walking trees with brains are kind of scary. They seem nice enough when they’re rambling through the forest explaining things to Merry and Pippin, but remember that everyone is chronically freaked out by their woods for years before the Hobbits get frustrated with Entish conversational pace.

2. **THE GREEN MAN: TALES FROM THE MYTHIC FOREST edited by Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling** - This is a fantastic collection of short stories that is tragically *out of print*. To catch a brief glimpse of the Green Man's long held position in British Isles folk lore and spirituality, do yourself a favor and Google "minster green man" for a healthy dose of peering stone faces and leaves-growing-out-of-a-guy's-mouth.

3. **UPROOTED by Naomi Novik** - This book starts off at a fairly temperate pace, the terrifying death forest just a nearby shadow that a rude wizard lives in--but once it picks up, it picks the heck up, and trees start coming at people in murderous flocks.

4. **A MONSTER CALLS by Patrick Ness** - When a tree walks up to your bedroom window, you expect a horror story. What you get is myth, grief, and catharsis.

5. **OD MAGIC and IN THE FORESTS OF SERRE by Patricia A. McKillip** - Patricia McKillip has a way of walking you into fairy with her language so thoroughly and bewitchingly that you're actually surprised to find yourself *not*Rip van Winkled when you put her books down.

6. **THE LAST UNICORN by Peter S. Beagle *-***Because a weirdly lusty magic tree is still a magic tree, she gets her spot on this list--and because if you've only ever seen the peculiarly true-to-the-novel movie, it's definitely time to give the book a try.

7. **THE RADIANT ROAD by Katherine Catmull** - A classic-feeling fairy-story that features not only an ancient yew growing into a small stone house that has been home to the same family of women for hundreds of years, but a fine opportunity for the main character to be a tree herself.

8. **THE RAVEN CYCLE by Maggie Stiefvater**- This much-loved YA series has...a lot going on. But it's particularly strong in tree magic, from magic woods to surprise tree people. SHHHH I'M NOT TELLING YOU ANYTHING. I would hate to spoil even one little piece of magic.

9. **THE CHILDREN OF GREEN KNOWE by Lucy M. Boston** - A classic children's series featuring ghosts, weird old British names, and topiaries that come to life. The odd quiet magic of living growing things has never been stronger, and it's never too late to read books like these.

Enjoy reading in the shade--and don't forget to thank the tree you're with.

\*Yes, I did.
