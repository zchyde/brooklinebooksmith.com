In February 2016 the Cuban government opened its doors to 40 American writers, educators, agents, booksellers, distributors and publishing representatives for a landmark conference. The delegation disembarked in Havana a month before Barack Obama is set to become the first sitting U.S. President to visit the island in 88 years (not since Calvin Coolidge held the Oval Office have relations between the two countries been so open.) According to [Publisher's Weekly](http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/international/international-book-news/article/69612-end-the-book-embargo-against-cuba.html):

> Cuba was represented by officials from the Cuban Book Institute, the Ministry of Culture, and the Cuban Writers Association, as well as by Cuban authors, publishers, academics, and students.... [The purpose of] the two days of meetings ... was to build bridges of understanding and explore opportunities for greater cultural and economic collaboration.

Subsequent to their return, members of the U.S. publishing mission put forth a petition (currently [open for signatures](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov//petition/end-book-embargo-against-cuba)) calling on Congress and the President to lift the American economic embargo on books and literature.

> Our position:
>
> - We ask Congress and the president to lift the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba related to the production, distribution, and sale of books and educational materials.
>
> - The U.S. trade embargo is harmful to book culture and runs counter to American ideals of free expression.
>
> - Books are catalysts for greater cross-cultural understanding, economic development, free expression, and positive social change.
>
> - Cuba boasts a rich and proud literary tradition with much to contribute to book culture.
>
> - Cuba's adult literacy rate—nearly 100%—is among the highest in the world.
>
> - Exciting commercial opportunities exist for the American and Cuban publishing communities to collaborate for the benefit of readers and writers everywhere.
>
> - The American book publishing community stands ready to help Cuba's writers and publishers gain access to the global book market, and to help the Cuban people gain greater access to the amazing diversity of books published by American publishers.

A toppling of the legislation that keeps American books from Cuban shelves would be an unquestionable financial boon for continental publishers - the country is an under-served market with a [nearly 100% literacy rate](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/latin-lessons-what-can-we-learn-from-the-worldrsquos-most-ambitious-literacy-campaign-2124433.html). After reading Tillman Miller's *[The Rise of the Cuban Literati](http://lithub.com/the-rise-of-the-cuban-literati-in-sunshine-and-in-shadow/)* for LitHub, though, one wonders what might be in it for Cuba. On the one hand, as Orlando Luis Pardo Lazo (Cuban novelist, blogger, photographer, and ICORN guest writer in Iceland) points out in his correspondence with Miller,

> The Cuban reader is a mediocre figure, it needs to be annihilated with a tender touch of text-rrorism... [For Havana to become a hotbed of literary culture] it would take Europe or America to be there again to, please, re-rediscover us. Our colonialized culture is congenital. A hotbed depends on euros and dollars to be really hot. It’s called prostitution and we are prone to it. Don’t be late: it takes two for a tango.

On the other hand,

> Malena Salazar Maci&aacute; (novelist in Havana): "Cuban publishing houses have their published plans very tight. They rarely accept manuscripts of unpublished writers. There is no publishing market. It is tortuous."
>
> Da&iacute;na Chaviano (novelist in Miami, author of [The Island of Eternal Love](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781594483790), the most widely translated Cuban novel of all time): "There is a huge wave of emigrant writers [now] that didn’t exist in the 80s. This literary exodus is leaving niches that can’t be fulfilled at the same speed. If a country can’t make its most prominent young writers stay at home, its literary ranks will face a permanent lack of growing, or at least a difficult time to progress."

As American commercial access to Cuban readers expands, it will be interesting to see whether opportunities for Cuban writers grow with it.
