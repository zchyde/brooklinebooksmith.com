![](/uploads/versions/curled1---x----967-194x---.jpg)The most noticeable result of this unbelievable humidity is that the covers of all the paperback books curl up, up and away. Booksellers have to add a new chore to their routine: switching the books at the top of the stack with the ones at the bottom. You want to know how you can avoid this chore with your home library? You can keep the moisture out by cramming more books&nbsp;*in*.&nbsp;
<br>Keep those shelves packed tight with an end-of-summer trip to Booksmith.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>And not to worry, we've got plenty of suggestions for your next read. If the impending return to school sparks in you an urge to get real, our buyer and ace bookseller Shuchi recently shared our [favorite nonfiction picks](http://www.wbur.org/radioboston/2016/08/12/summer-non-fiction)&nbsp;on WBUR's Radio Boston. And if instead you are searching for a last flight of fancy, check out an earlier program (featuring guest&nbsp;[Margot Livesey](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/search/site/margot%2520livesey), who will be reading here in the fall!) where they&nbsp;[focused on great fiction](http://www.wbur.org/radioboston/2016/07/29/summer-reading-fiction). Whatever your cup of tea may be, we're keeping it on ice over here at Booksmith.

Although we don't have a firm date for Margot Livesey's visit yet, our events calendar is chock full of talent for the next couple of months:&nbsp;[Susan Senator](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-09/autism-adulthood---strategies-and-insights-for-a-fulfilling-life/),&nbsp;[Mary Karr](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-09/mary-karr---the-art-of-memoir/),&nbsp;[Jonathan Safran Foer](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/jonathan-safran-foer-on-98-presented-by-brookline-booksmith-and-the-jewish-arts-collaborative-tickets-26568940416),&nbsp;[Amy Stewart](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-09/amy-stewart---lady-cop-makes-trouble-a-kopp-sisters-novel/), and a lot, lot more. &nbsp;
