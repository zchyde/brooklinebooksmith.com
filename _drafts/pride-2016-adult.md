June has been LGBT+ Pride month for a long time, in various capacities and at various levels of acceptance. Although the popular image of Pride now is of vast, brightly colored, highly commercialized parades, Pride at its heart is--or was--a grassroots affair. The early activity that eventually birthed today's loudly advertised parades were organized largely by a bisexual activist named Brenda Howard in 1970. They were a combined celebration of self and a commemoration of the miserable and brutal anti-LGBT Stonewall Riots of 1969.

Forty-six years later, the word Brenda Howard used to describe herself is still a ghost in pop culture--no matter what they do or say on screen or on page, fictional characters just can't seem to get the word "bisexual" to pass their lips.

Pride has a lot of history, though, and it's not all rainbow streamers and pleasantly surprising outfits. STONEWALL/CHRISTOPHER STREET LIBERATION DAY (books about this piece of history often minimize or erase the central figures of transgender women)
