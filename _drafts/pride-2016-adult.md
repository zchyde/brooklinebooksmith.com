June has been LGBT+ Pride month for a long time, in various capacities and at various levels of acceptance. Although the popular image of Pride now is of vast, brightly colored, highly commercialized parades, Pride at its heart is–or was–a grassroots affair. The early activities that eventually birthed today's loudly advertised parades were organized largely by a bisexual activist named Brenda Howard, beginning in 1970. They were a combined celebration of self and commemoration of the miserable, brutal anti-LGBT Stonewall Riots of 1969.

Forty-six years later, the word Brenda Howard used to describe herself is still a ghost in pop culture–no matter what they do or say on screen or on page, fictional characters just can't seem to get the word "bisexual" to pass their lips. Forty-six years later, we have nationally recognized same gender marriages, and returned the rights of LGBT+ people to serve openly in our armed forces. Forty-six years later, LGBT+ youth[are disproportionately homeless](http://nationalhomeless.org/issues/lgbt/). Forty-six years later, a higher proportion of transgender people [are being murdered](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/13/transgender-homicide-victims-us-has-hit-historic-high). Pride is a time of celebration, but it comes from a place of being silenced and refusing to remain so. Its roots are still relevant.

If you'd like to celebrate, reflect, or learn, I have a suggestion: books.
<br>
<br>Check our LGBT+ section, located next to history. Try a little history with Robert Beachy's [Gay Berlin](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780307473134). Mentally argue for or against the anti-marriage stances in [Against Equality: Queer Revolution, Not Mere Inclusion](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781849351843). Get some friendly girltalk from Lindsay King-Miller in [Ask a Queer Chick: A Guide to Sex, Love, and Life for Girls Who Dig Girls](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780147516787). Learn about a lesser-known sexuality with [The Invisible Orientation](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781634502436). Try checking downstairs, as well–our [Used Book Cellar](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/used-books/) usually carries about twice as much LGBT+ literature as our upstairs.

Read the LGBT+ classics. Find Alison Bechdel's [Fun Home](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780618871711) in graphica, and while you're there check out [Dykes to Watch Out For](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780618968800). Head to humor for the works of David Sedaris, or check out Patricia Highsmith over in mystery. Find Oscar Wilde doing his thing in drama and fiction. Keep your eyes open for a used copy of Stone Butch Blues. Read James Baldwin and Sarah Waters, and the poetry of W.H. Auden.

Delve into hidden history. Read the classics written by authors you did not know were LGBT+ because they didn't tell you that part in school. Read Langston Hughes and Truman Capote, T.S. Eliot, Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.
<br>
<br>Find all of these, and others, on our shelves, specially bookmarked throughout the store for the month of June. Learn, remember, and celebrate. Go [see the parade](http://www.bostonpride.org/), if you like. And don't forget: the books are always here, even when they're not as easy to pick out from the crowd.
