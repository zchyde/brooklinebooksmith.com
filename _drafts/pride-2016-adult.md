June has been LGBT+ Pride month for a long time, in various capacities and at various levels of acceptance. Although the popular image of Pride now is of vast, brightly colored, highly commercialized parades, Pride at its heart is--or was--a grassroots affair. The early activity that eventually birthed today's loudly advertised parades were organized largely by a bisexual activist named Brenda Howard in 1970. They were a combined celebration of self and a commemoration of the miserable and brutal anti-LGBT Stonewall Riots of 1969.

Forty-six years later, the word Brenda Howard used to describe herself is still a ghost in pop culture--no matter what they do or say on screen or on page, fictional characters just can't seem to get the word "bisexual" to pass their lips. Forty-six years later, we have nationally recognized same gender marriages, and returned the rights of LGBT+ people to serve openly in our armed forces. Forty-six years later, LGBT+ youth[are disproportionately homeless](http://nationalhomeless.org/issues/lgbt/). Forty-six years later, a higher proportion of transgender people [are being murdered](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/13/transgender-homicide-victims-us-has-hit-historic-high). Pride is a time of celebration, but it comes from a place of being silenced and refusing to remain so. Its roots are still relevant.
