![](/uploads/versions/hippos---x----742-576x---.jpg)As the old sing-song says:&nbsp;
<br>
<br>*No more pencils,
<br>No more books,&nbsp;*
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (HEY, NOT SO FAST)
<br>*No more teacher's dirty looks.*
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (This one is actually true: since a teacher assessment protocol was put in place to record and analyze the intensity, duration and efficacy of dirty looks in the classroom, most teachers have removed dirty looks from their bag of tricks.)
<br>
<br>For some lucky students, the school year is already a distant memory. For our family, summer vacation is so close, my kids can almost taste it!&nbsp;
<br>(it tastes like bubble solution and hose water.)&nbsp;
<br>
<br>But getting back to that second line of the song: don't be ridiculous.&nbsp;
<br>Now is the time for summer reading. It's*always* time for reading.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>And thanks to the great teachers at Brookline's schools, summer reading doesn't have to be a drag. The lists of recommended and required summer reading are a terrific mix of the old and the new, with plenty of compelling narratives and stellar writing that have a shot at turning even the most reluctant reader into a compulsive page-turner before the next school year begins. Our kids department has been working overtime to turn Booksmith into an efficient summer reading list delivery system for each grade at each school. Don't wait, pick up your books before you head off on vacation?
<br>
<br>Oh, and why the hippos? My third grader got to be the legs in a life-size game of Hungry Hungry Hippos at his school yesterday. He pushed his laundry basket-wielding teammate around the gym on a little wheelie dolly, and they fought all the other hippos for balls.&nbsp;
<br>Not to brag, but yeah, they won.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK!
<br>
<br>Thanks for reading,
