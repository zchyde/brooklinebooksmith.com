National Arbor Day, a celebration of our trees, is this Friday, April 29…..&nbsp; This tree-focused holiday is always the last Friday in April, every year.

The first National Arbor Day celebration was on April 10, 1872; some say that 1 million trees were planted that first “tree day.”&nbsp; Julius Sterling Morton (1832-1902), a Nebraska editor, who was also considered an expert in agriculture and forestry, founded Arbor Day.&nbsp; Morton served as President Grover Cleveland's Secretary of Agriculture from 1893-1897.&nbsp; The Arbor Day Foundation (ADF) was established in 1972.
