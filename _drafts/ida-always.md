Grief is a perhaps the most difficult emotion of all to explain. It is complicated, messy, awkward, and very individual.

One of the hardest tasks a parent, or guardian is faced with is explaining grief in all its faucets and nuances to a child.

This week&nbsp; a beautiful picture book was released.

Gus and Ida are best of friends. They play together, eat together, and listen to the surrounding city's heartbeat together. But one day Ida gets sick and there is no cure. Gus knows that their days together are never going to be the same, but the two friends make the best of it. They have good days, and bad days, and days where they don't quite know what they are feeling.
