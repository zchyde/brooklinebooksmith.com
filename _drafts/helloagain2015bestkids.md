Whew! That sure was the holidays. With the pinnacle of gift-giving season behind us, the shelves restocked, and the deep breaths taken, I'm very excited to turn back to my old friend the Booksmith blog–now hosted on our new website, and involving a whole new process, so please: if you see something way, way weird in here, blame me. It's my fault. Mine and the technology's. There's a reason I'm primarily engaged with paper books.

Since the last time you heard from me, the website is not the only thing that's braved and dazzled the public eye. The American Library Association Youth Media Awards, AKA the Oscars of kids' books (although, um, we've seen the nominations, and we think our awards did a *little* better than they did), were announced on January 11.

The Newbery was a historic choice this year. Usually the granddaddy of all children's literature prizes goes to a middle grade novel, but this time the award went to Matt de la Peña and Christian Robinson's picture book [*Last Stop on Market Street*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780399257742). The Caldecott went to *[Finding Winnie](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316324908),*[which has been featured on our blog before](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/2015/11/02/bear-in-mind/). These are only the two best-known prizes, though–a full list can be found [here](http://www.ilovelibraries.org/article/2016-youth-media-awards-winners), and you can find most of the winners on display in the Kids' section.

Your very gratified booksellers were thrilled to see a number of their favorites on the awards roster. Among my most-loved 2015 books, *[The War that Saved My Life](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780803740815)*by Kimberley Brubaker Bradley earned a Newbery Honor; [*George*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780545812542) by Alex Gino won a Stonewall Award; and [*Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062348678) by Becky Albertalli came home with the Morris Award for best debut Young Adult novel. [*The Weight of Feathers*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781250058652) by Anna-Marie McLemore, one of Amy's favorites, took a Morris Honor, and [*Bone Gap*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062317605) by Laura Ruby (recommended by Clarissa) took the Printz award for Young Adult literature.

This is a long, unwieldy list, but listen: we LOVE these books. Come talk to us about them–we're wildly happy that they've all been recognized, alongside a big stack of other wonderful books.

Meanwhile–

Maybe they didn't get all the awards, but if you check out our front window, you'll also find the Kidsmith booksellers' own first-place favorites for 2015.

[Maybe you want](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780553499117) a sprawling space opera filled with chaos, reluctant romance, and paperwork that really should not be getting into the wrong hands.

[Maybe you want](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780062403162) the story of all those other people, the normal kids just on the fringes of the Chosen Few, those extras in Sunnydale who never get a line, but they know *something* is weird about their school.

[Maybe you want](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781481432320) a boy who is terrified of a baby brother who might not live, and the quiet, insistent, dry-winged monsters in the attic who whisper promises of better things. Maybe you want a book where love is stronger than monsters.

Whatever you want, we've got a favorite for you. And, striding and reading into 2016 with a vengeance, we're sure to have more children's book love to share with you the next time you ask.
