Fans of [The Lunar Chronicles](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781250113221), rejoice!

Marissa Meyer's latest foray into fairy-tale retellings does not disappoint though this time rather than focusing on the heroes she is giving a voice to the "villains".

In [*Heartless*](https://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781250044655), we meet Catherineâ€“the young girl destined to become the Queen of Hearts. She wants nothing more than the simple life of owning her own bakery with her best friend. Simple things rarely happen in Wonderland, however, and on the night that the King of Hearts is meant to announce his proposal to her, Catherine meets and quickly becomes enamored with Jest, the King's newest fool. The story that ensues is both heartbreaking and beautiful.&nbsp;

What I enjoyed most about The Lunar Chronicles was the personality of each character, and how wonderfully their stories came together while still giving you glimpses of those classic stories that you know so well. Mixing elements both of Lewis Carroll's stories and Poe's *Raven*, *Heartless* brings to life a compelling batch of comparably quirky characters that are sure to amuse.
