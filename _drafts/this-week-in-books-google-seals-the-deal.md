On March 15th the Authors Guild [filed its final reply brief](http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/copyright/article/69676-after-latest-filings-google-case-now-in-supreme-court-s-hands.html) in the case of *Authors Guild vs. Google*, a dispute that first reared its head in 2005 after the technology company launched Google Books to digitize print libraries. The brief is widely believed to be the death throes of the Guild's more than decade-long push to limit the project's scope beyond public domain works to include published material still under copyright. From the [Authors Guild site](https://www.authorsguild.org/where-we-stand/authors-guild-v-google/):

> Google argued, and still argues, that its book-search program… offers great public benefits and therefore the copying should be protected under the legal doctrine of “fair use.” We do not believe that private companies should be able to make full digital copies of copyrighted books en masse for commercial purposes under the fair use doctrine—that is, without compensating the rightsholders.

As *The Atlantic*'s Dan Cohen [reported back in October](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/10/what-the-google-books-victory-means-for-readers-and-libraries/411910/) after the Second Circuit sided with Google, the threat posed by these conflicting interests may never have materialized:

> Although Google did tip entire library shelves into the scanner without regard for copyright status—triggering an unsurprising revolt from authors and publishers—the tech giant only shows small “snippets” of in-copyright works. The full digitized books are walled-off, making only certain uses possible. Researchers can fact-check using Google Books, or they can examine the number of times particular words and phrases are mentioned in the corpus each year, but they can’t really read Google’s online version of most volumes... What Google has created is less a universal library than a tinted window into one.

As the legal dispute draws to a close, what does this mean for readers (especially when the future of digital print looks [decidedly murky](http://www.readersfirst.org/news/2016/3/2/is-the-commercial-ebook-market-really-slowing-down)? The Atlantic article goes into greater depth, but Cohen ruefully notes that,

> A lawsuit can run on for so long that, even if major issues are still at stake, it can seem dated and even inconsequential by the time it’s resolved…&nbsp; So much has changed on the Internet, in libraries, and with books in the decade since the Authors Guild first filed suit. In 2005, Google was a relatively young search engine—it had only gone public the previous year—looking to expand its horizon beyond the web. Now Google is part of a conglomerate named Alphabet, and Google Books seems very much like an early, vestigial effort among Alphabet’s larger body of projects, which includes higher-profile ventures like self-driving cars.

For good or for bad, the digital preservation of vast tracts of literature at least means I, you, and [the news team at](__notset__)[FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-favorite-examples-of-how-the-internet-talks-on-reddit/) can still spend hours on [Google Ngram](https://books.google.com/ngrams) studying quirky particular histories of the written word.
