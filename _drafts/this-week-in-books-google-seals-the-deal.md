On March 15th the Authors Guild [filed its final reply brief](http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/copyright/article/69676-after-latest-filings-google-case-now-in-supreme-court-s-hands.html) in the case of *Authors Guild vs. Google*, a dispute that first reared its head in 2005 after the inception of Google Books, a paper-to-screen scanning program launched by the tech giant to digitize print libraries. The brief is widely believed to be the death throes of the Guild's more than decade-long push to limit the project's scope beyond public domain works to include published material still under copyright. From the [Authors Guild site](https://www.authorsguild.org/where-we-stand/authors-guild-v-google/):

> Google argued, and still argues, that its book-search program... offers great public benefits and therefore the copying should be protected under the legal doctrine of “fair use.” We do not believe that private companies should be able to make full digital copies of copyrighted books en masse for commercial purposes under the fair use doctrine—that is, without compensating the rightsholders.

As *The Atlantic*'s Dan Cohen [reported back in October](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/10/what-the-google-books-victory-means-for-readers-and-libraries/411910/) after the Second Circuit sided with Google, the threat posed by these conflicting interests may never have materialized:

> [A]s audacious as Google Books appeared at its inception, it seems less monumental today. Although Google did tip entire library shelves into the scanner without regard for copyright status—triggering an unsurprising revolt from authors and publishers—the tech giant only shows small “snippets” of in-copyright works. The full digitized books are walled-off, making only certain uses possible. Researchers can fact-check using Google Books, or they can examine the number of times particular words and phrases are mentioned in the corpus each year, but they can’t really read Google’s online version of most volumes. What Google has created is less a universal library than a tinted window into one.

As the legal dispute draws to a close,
