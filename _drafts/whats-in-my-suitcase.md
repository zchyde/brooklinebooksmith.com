Every time I take a trip, I find that my suitcase is overly full of books–I will forsake extra clothes, and gladly repeat the same shoes for the entirety of my trip if it means that I can add more books to my bag. I never want to be the person who is stuck without something exciting to read, and so I tend to overcompensate. (I am trying to get better about this!) As I type this blog post, I am in the process of making a list of things to take with me on a month-long journey across the pond to study British libraries in England and Scotland! In an attempt to minimize my luggage, I am only taking **four** books outside of the ones that I need for my classes. My current plan is to take 1 book that I have never read which will be something to lose myself in at night when my mind is racing from the excitements of the day. The other 3 books must be something that I have known and love that warm my heart in some way, and that I can hopefully gift to friends I meet along my journey! (Because I will undoubtedly buy MORE books while I'm there, and what better way to commemorate new friendships than with books?)

Here are the books that made the final cut!

A Court of Thorns and Roses by Sarah J. Maas

I absolutely adore fairy tale retellings, and somehow this one evaded my grasp! After listening to Clarissa gush about it for the past few months I decided to give it a shot, and it was a great choice! I'm only halfway through it at present because I've had to devote my reading time to the world of Academia, but I find myself constantly thinking about it when I am not actively reading it. This, to me, is the mark of a great travel book!

Great Mouse Detective: Basil of Baker Street by Eve Titus

Sherlock Holmes as a mouse! I'll primarily be living in London during my journey, and while I already know there aren't any evident mouse holes at 221B Baker Street (though I wasn't able to visit the cellar upon my last visit so who knows!) I'd feel rather incomplete making the journey without this childhood favorite! Alex and I literally squeaked with delight when it appeared on our shelves! The adventures of Basil and Dawson are as legendary to my younger heart as those of Sherlock and Watson are to me now!

Inkheart by Cornelia Funke

A story where the reading aloud of a book can bring the characters into our world while simultaneously taking someone into its own inky depths? Sign me up! What better story could accompany a future librarian on her journey? I haven't visited this world in ages, but it is one of those books that strengthened my love of reading, propelling me onto my current life path. Amy's rec says it all, that this is "a book for people who love books."

My Mama Says There Aren't Any Zombies, Ghosts, Vampires, Creatures, Demons, Monsters, Fiends, Goblins or Things by Judith Viorst

Pure nostalgia here. I adored this story as a child. My copy–though still somehow in tact!–is rather worn and battered. My mother read me many stories as a child, and this is one that left a strangely permanent mark on my heart. Bringing it with me is like bringing her with me as well!

So there you have it. A rather concise list that should keep me entertained without going over the weight limit for my suitcase leaving room for me to bring as many books back home with me as I am able!
