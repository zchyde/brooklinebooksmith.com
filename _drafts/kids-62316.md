The Pulse night club shooting has made the last week and a half a bitterly difficult week and a half for many people. This week, the kids' team is fortunate to come together with children's booksellers nationwide at the yearly Children's Institute conference. This year's CI takes place in Orlando. I've never been south of Pennsylvania, and I won't say the timing for my first visit doesn't hurt my heart. The truth is, however, that my hurt can walk away.

It's in complicated, massive, and terrible situations like this that I like to remember Silk's [Ring Theory of grief](http://articles.latimes.com/2013/apr/07/opinion/la-oe-0407-silk-ring-theory-20130407). Succinctly explained, everyone's grief is valid, but the kind and productive thing to do is to express your grief to those who hurt less than you do, and comfort those who hurt worse--those are closer to the source of pain. It might be a good thing to remember, not just this week but every day. Listen to the wounded; share your own pain outward. Don't put weight on the people who are already carrying the worst burdens.

Here's something else to remember. Only[a few weeks ago](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/2016/06/03/pride-2016/), I wrote that Pride has always come from the midst of violent opposition, and it has always been (willfully, deliberately) a celebration. This week at Children's Institute, we celebrate books. So today, I want to embrace the spirit of both. Today I want to celebrate, remember, and thank some of the (often quietly, sometimes fearfully) LGB authors and illustrators who gave me and countless others our&nbsp; childhoods.

It's important to recognize why the basic facts of these lives aren't common knowledge. A number of these creators died young, their personal lives hidden from their reading public and even their publishers. Several of them died of AIDS, but no one was allowed to talk about it for years because AIDS meant gay, and a gay children’s author was unthinkable for public consumption. The public that raved about their books didn't want them to exist. Despite the strain of hiding, however, these incredible authors and illustrators shared with us books that are life-changing, world-sculpting, brilliant, wild, wonderful.

Here are some of my favorites:

Margaret Wise Brown: Author of *The Runaway Bunny, Goodnight Moon, Home for a Bunny, The Big Red Barn, The Little Fur Family,* and many other gentle and beloved picture books.

![](/uploads/versions/depaola---x----500-397x---.jpg)

Tomie de Paola: Author and illustrator of *Bill and Pete, Strega Nona, 26 Fairmont Avenue, The Art Lesson*, and many, many more, with a particular flair for unforgettable characters, and child-oriented autobiography.

![](/uploads/versions/sendak---x----500-451x---.jpg)

Maurice Sendak: Author and illustrator best known for *Where the Wild Things Are* and *In the Night Kitchen*--both of which catch a lot of flak from grown-ups for giving kids wicked ideas.

James Marshall: Uproarious illustrator of more books than he wrote, to whom nothing was entirely sacred. Best known for *George and Martha,*but also author of my beloved *Wings, Space Case, The Cut-Ups,*illustrator of Harry Allard's *Miss Nelson Is Missing*, and much else.

![](/uploads/versions/harriet---x----350-513x---.jpg)

Louise Fitzhugh: Author of *Harriet the Spy*, whose tomboyish misfit of a trouble-finding, difficult, sometimes heartless heroine won me over for life--heartless or not.

![](/uploads/versions/lobel---x----350-506x---.jpg)

Arnold Lobel: Author and illustrator of mostly books for beginning readers, best known for *Frog and Toad,*who taught all of us who read them about adventure, humor, and how to be a really incredible friend. I was equally fond of *Small Pig,*though--there was something about all the mud-vacuuming the farmer's wife does.

Their books find their way into the hands of children who need them. Some of those children are queer, and some them, even today, may have to become adults before they even learn that they’re not bad. Maybe they'll love books for decades before they learn that some of their favorite authors and greatest heroes have been on their team all along. Maybe this is you. But these authors were always here. They were always on your team. And today we make the decision that the truth now is better than a surprise decades later. Today we celebrate and determine that we won't forget.

Obviously there are out-and-proud authors/illustrators, more and more as time goes on. There are others whom I've missed here from earlier days (including, be still my heart, the phenomenal illustrator Trina Schart Hyman). These photos are of what books I keep in my house as an adult, and they're my childhood copies--with the exception of *Home for a Bunny*. I was very careful with books as a child, but a book feels all the reading you do to it, no matter how careful you are. I just barely stopped short of loving all of these to bits. Knowing where they come from, I love them even more.
