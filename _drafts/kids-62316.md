The Pulse night club shooting has made the last week and a half a bitterly difficult week and a half for many people. This week, the kids' team is fortunate to come together with children's booksellers nationwide at the yearly Children's Institute conference. This year, CI takes place in Orlando. I've never been south of Pennsylvania, and I won't say the timing for my first visit doesn't hurt my heart. The truth is, however, that my hurt can walk away.

It's in complicated, massive, and terrible situations like this that I like to remember Silk's [Ring Theory of grief](http://articles.latimes.com/2013/apr/07/opinion/la-oe-0407-silk-ring-theory-20130407). Succinctly explained, everyone's grief is valid, but the kind and productive thing to do is to express your grief to those who hurt less than you do, and comfort those who hurt worse--those are closer to the source of pain. It might be a good thing to remember, not just this week but every day. Listen to the wounded; share your own pain outward. Don't put weight on the people who are already carrying the worst burdens.

This week at Children's Institute, we celebrate books, and that's what I'm going to do here as well. Only[a few weeks ago](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/2016/06/03/pride-2016/), I wrote that Pride has always come from the midst of violent opposition, and it has always been (willfully, deliberately) a celebration. So today, let's celebrate. Let's celebrate LGB authors and illustrators who change children's lives, as readers, as writers, and as people.
