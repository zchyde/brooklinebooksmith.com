Every year, the [American Hiking Society](http://www.americanhiking.org/about-us/) organizes and coordinates&nbsp;[National Trails Day](http://nationaltrailsday.americanhiking.org/) (NTD), a celebration of America’s outstanding Trail System. This year, the celebration falls on June 4th.&nbsp; Local communities can host events, such as a run for the woods, hiking experiences, stewardship projects, bird watching expeditions, trail biking journeys, geocaching, and much more.&nbsp; What kinds of adventures are you planning for NTD? &nbsp;Click [here](http://nationaltrailsday.americanhiking.org/events/#page-1) to find events close to you. ![](/uploads/versions/travel-section---x----3264-2448x---.jpg)
