My first glimpse of Margaret Cavendish came in the Spring of 2011 at the University of Maine. Danielle Dutton was giving a reading for the New Writing Series from her manuscript in progress, a memoiresque novel of the Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. I was floored by the musicality of Dutton's language and the electric impulse of her heroine's romanticism - a gift for prose very much in the vein of Virginia Woolf, I would reflect five years later with the published work, *Margaret the Firs*t, finally in hand. Michele Filgate drew the same conclusion in her glowing profile of Dutton last month for the LA Times, and New York Times reviewer Katharine Grant heralded the author for "expertly [capturing] the pathos of a woman whose happiness is furrowed with the anxiety of &shy;underacknowledgment."
