My first glimpse of Margaret Cavendish came in the Spring of 2011 at the University of Maine. Danielle Dutton was giving a reading for the New Writing Series from her manuscript in progress, a memoiresque novel of the Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. I was floored by the musicality of Dutton's language and the electric impulse of her heroine's romanticism - a gift for prose very much in the vein of Virginia Woolf, I would reflect five years later with the published work, *Margaret the Firs*t, finally in hand. New York Times reviewer Katharine Grant [drew the same conclusion](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/03/books/review/danielle-duttons-margaret-the-first.html?_r=0), heralding Dutton for "expertly [capturing] the pathos of a woman whose happiness is furrowed with the anxiety of &shy;underacknowledgment."
