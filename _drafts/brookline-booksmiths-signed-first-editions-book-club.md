![](/uploads/versions/barnesgyassi---x0-0-581-455-581-455x---.jpg)We're proud to announce our very own Signed First Editions Book Club! Think of it as a book of the month club, with a twist - every book is a first edition and signed by the author. The dust jacket gets a protective cover to keep it pristine and collectible for your home library.

Every one of these titles come with the Booksmith seal of approval - these are books that we have read, loved, and want to share with you!
