I wasn't a voracious reader as a child. I was rambunctious and had approximately no desire to make myself sit still long enough to get through a book. What I did have a desire for were stories. That's not to say that I didn't read anything. I did, just not as much as people assume when they hear that I'm a children's bookseller. Rather than sitting and reading I was more likely to be found outside making up some unnecessarily elaborate story for why we were wearing bed sheets in the backyard and being loudly upset when someone didn't follow the story that I had meticulously created.

As I reached an age where telling elaborate stories instead of having a conversation ceased to be cute, I realized that I wasn't really great with people. I think it was around this same time that I developed a dislike for being outside.&nbsp;

For a while I turned to drawing as my indoor activity of choice. I could draw terrible pictures of my elaborate scenes! While staying inside! My mum is an amazing artist and who doesn't want to be like their mum? The problem with this, of course, was that one of my sisters was significantly better at art than me. That, of course, would not do.

When I was in third grade my family moved and I manged to find friends who also liked to do most things indoors. We watched movies and made up insane scenarios and games that we could enact inside. These friends were perfect (I mean, they still are). I still got to make up my weirdly intricate stories but now I had people to build them with. We worked off of each other and in a lot of ways I think they were my first critique partners.
<br>
<br>It wasn't until middle school that I really discovered reading and realized that maybe writing was the thing for me. In sixth grade we had to write and illustrate books to read to kindergartners for Halloween.&nbsp;

<br>
<br>I didn't do particularly well on that assignment.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>It was the next year that I found my first Tamora Pierce book, and it hit me like a punch to the chest, that I realized that was what I wanted to do. I wanted to make other people feel the way that I did when I read that book.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Even now, many years later, I'm on a quest to both find more books that make me feel that way and write books that do that to someone else. There are so few adult books that do for me.
<br>
<br>I think a big part of that is that I am always looking to change and evolve. I want to be better, a stronger writer, a more patient person, more clever, more concise and the characters in children's books are always changing. The traditional age range for children's books is one where you change a lot very quickly so the characters are constantly on the verge of becoming something else. I want to always feel on the verge of being something new. They question everything and analyze everything they do in a way that I think many adults pretend that they don't as they get older. I never want to grow out of that. I want to always examine why I do what I do. I want to be aware of myself in the world in a way that children's books almost always acknowledge.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>I didn't come into reading really young but I did come into it when I needed it the most. When the stories in my head needed a new outlet. When I started to realize that social interactions didn't feed me the way that they did a lot of other people but that stories filled me to my brim.&nbsp;
