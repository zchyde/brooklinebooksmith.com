I first became hip to Brian Chippendale back in 2002. I was standing in a now-defunct record store in Cambridge rifling through the new arrivals when it hit me-actually more like singed my fingertips. I was assured by the clerk that upon listening to the record, my face would melt off. Myself not being much of a looker, I took the risk. And *Ride The Skies* by the band Lightning Bolt would become a cherished fixture in my record collection.

Besides the ferocious nature of the music, I was equally captivated by the cover art. It looked like Henry Darger trying to create Nintendo kill screens. The coarse feel of the ink hinted at something handmade, unique, one of a kind. On the cover, a crowded, clouded caravan fleeing from the ruins of a mythical world [my take]. Pretty neat, I thought. I went back to the record store a week later and asked the same clerk if he knew who did the cover. “The drummer,” he said. “Brian Chippendale.”

I’ve always had a voracious appetite for comics. From my days as a rugrat, through my tempestuous career as a student, and even today, in my life of faux luxury, I consume a lot of graphic literature. The weirder the better. The same can be said about my love for music. Much of Chippendale’s work, from the early *Ninja*series and the weighted treasure of *If ‘N Oof*, all the way up to his newest invention, *Puke Force*, there oozes a strong whiff of musicality.

*Puke Force* centers around a team of weirdos who seek to protect Grave City from some seriously terrible monsters: social injustice, corrupt government, and personified YouTube comments. Each panel is an IV drip containing a mixture of satire and sarcasm. It is a chaotic depiction of a chaotic world - composed in the same manner as David Lynch’s [*Eraserhead*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK-2_OsBe0s)or Albert Ayler’s iconic free jazz masterpiece [*Spirits Rejoice*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-0b5Rodwsg). It looks like a giant cloud of scribbles but after awhile you begin to sense the rhythm and read along to its unique, one of a kind beat. Puke Force isn’t fleeing from the ruins in terror; it’s heading straight towards it with gritted teeth and clenched fists.

Brian Chippendale is a genius and you should accept this genius into your life by purchasing *Puke Force* [here](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781770462199):&nbsp;
