![](/uploads/versions/stairwellgallery---x----1762-340x---.jpg)![](/uploads/versions/cabral---x----900-676x---.JPG)We are proud to announce the opening of the Stairwell Gallery at Brookline Booksmith. Stairwell Gallery is a new space for art, hovering between our ground floor and the Used Book Cellar, which will showcase rotating exhibits of Boston area artists. Working in any media, hailing from any neighborhood - the only criteria is that their work has moved us, inspired us, or just caught and held our eye. Our hope is that some of it will cause you to stop on the stairs and take a longer look.
<br>And if something truly moves you, buy it! 100% of sales go directly to the artist. Already up on the gallery wall is&nbsp;[Steven Cabral](http://www.stevenjcabral.com/)'s angular, richly colored abstract paintings, and this evening he will be joined by&nbsp;[Eli Portman](http://eliportman.weebly.com/), with his personal, densely detailed drawings of architecture and landscape.

<br>In our&nbsp;[events series](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/)&nbsp;we look forward to a week of great readings, culminating with the return of [T.C. Boyle](https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-10/t-c--boyle---the-terranauts/). But first, of course, we are all surely thrilled at the prospect of the very, very last fun and informative Presidential debate. Have a good book handy. When you just can't stand to watch it for another second you can switch the debate off and escape into someplace less stressful, like Hogwarts, or maybe the ninth circle of Dante's hell.

<br>The American Repertory Theater is about to break a few rules of theater when they open&nbsp;[The Garden](http://americanrepertorytheater.org/events/show/mini-series-%E2%80%94-garden), part of their&nbsp;[Mini Series: Performance for Small Audiences](http://americanrepertorytheater.org/events/festival/mini-series-performance-small-audiences). You and three other audience members will slip on a pair of headphones and set out on solo and intersecting paths; an intimate journey inspired by Italo Calvino’s&nbsp;[Invisible Cities](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780156453806)&nbsp;and Jorge Luis Borges’ short story “The Garden of Forking Paths.” Tickets are (obviously) limited to this one-of-a-kind experiment in interactive performance, so&nbsp;[click here](http://americanrepertorytheater.org/calendarsearch?date_start[date]=Sep+08%2C+2016&amp;date_end[date]=&amp;field_venue_term_tid=All&amp;field_st_performance_time_value[min][date]=2016-09-08&amp;field_st_performance_time_value[max][date]=2017-09-08&amp;nid=23320&amp;field_event_org_tid=All&amp;field_event_category_tid[]=156)&nbsp;to sign up for your time slot.

<br>Oh, hey, if you see Bob Dylan around, tell him the Nobel Prize people have been asking for him. [He won't even pick up the phone](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/17/nobel-prize-committee-gives-up-trying-to-contact-bob-dylan/).
