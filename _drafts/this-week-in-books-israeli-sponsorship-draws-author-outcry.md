An open letter addressed to the [PEN American Center](https://www.pen.org/) in March sparked controversy when it was released to the public last week. The letter, which was signed by more than a hundred authors, criticized the organization for accepting sponsorship from the Israeli government. PEN responded in an email to its members that refers to its policy of non-participation in cultural boycotts.

PEN, originally an acronym for "Poets, Essayists, Novelists," now extends to "Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists, Novelists," and includes writers of any form of literature, such as journalists and historians. It is the world's oldest human rights organization and the oldest international literary organization. The open letter released Wednesday addresses the foundation's American branch, specifically the funding of its annual World Voices Festival, and potentially puts the American Center at odds with its international counterparts. As [reported in the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/06/israeli-backing-for-new-york-festival-rejected-in-angry-letter-by-authors):

Among the writers who have put their names to the protest are the former president and vice president of English PEN, Gillian Slovo and Kamila Shamsie; poet Eileen Myles; authors Louise Erdrich and Ahdaf Soueif; and the Palestinian writer Ahmad Qatamesh, whose imprisonment without charge by the Israeli government was [criticised by PEN International](https://www.pen.org/rapid-action/2011/05/25/writer-and-academic-detained-without-charge-0).

The letter's signatories also include prominent literary figures Alice Walker, Angela Davis, and Junot D&iacute;az. The full list of dissenters, along with the full text of the letter, can be read at [Adalah-NY, The New York Campaign for the Boycott of Israel](https://adalahny.org/web-action/1376/letter-pen-american-center-don-t-partner-israeli-government).

"It is deeply regrettable that the festival has chosen to accept sponsorship from the Israeli government, even as it intensifies its decades-long denial of basic rights to the Palestinian people, including the frequent targeting of Palestinian writers and journalists"
