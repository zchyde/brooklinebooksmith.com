![](/uploads/versions/091416type---x----206-246x---.jpg)As I write this, we are awaiting the early morning arrival of the first yellow school bus filled with dozens of students from Roxbury Prep charter school. Each year these lucky kids take a field trip to the bookstore - but honestly I feel like&nbsp;*we're*&nbsp;the lucky ones in this whole deal. There is nothing like a big group of cheerful, curious, excited young readers to drive home the truth that books are vital, that bookstores are important, and that our work as booksellers is worthwhile.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>There're a few books breaking new ground in one way or another this week: the first collected volume of [Ta-Nehisi Coates](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-return-of-the-black-panther/471516/)'&nbsp;*Black Panther*&nbsp;comics; [Sungju Lee](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sungju-lee/every-falling-star/)'s&nbsp;*Every Falling Star*, a YA memoir about his five years as a kotjebi, or street orphan in North Korea; and Ann Patchett's&nbsp;*Commonwealth*, a "[reverse-engineered](http://flavorwire.com/589254/reverse-engineering-the-family-novel-patchetts-commonwealth)" family novel. And I can personally recommend a much quieter new arrival, reminiscent of the best of Per Petterson, and drawing comparison to&nbsp;*Stoner*&nbsp;by John Williams': [Robert Seethaler](http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/a-whole-life-by-robert-seethaler-one-man-endures-one-day-at-a-time-1.2394527)'s&nbsp;*A Whole Life*. These are all featured below among our new arrivals, but they deserve an extra push.
<br>
<br>Now, those students just arrived, and I've got to get out there and help them find their books, so I'm just going to leave a bunch of links here for you to check out. [Poetry on the T](http://www.masspoetry.org/poetryonthet), the last days of [hot metal typesetting](http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2016/09/a-fascinating-film-about-the-last-day-of-hot-metal-typesetting-at-the-new-york-times/) at the&nbsp;*New York Times*, an inspiring [competition for young writers](http://learn.hmhco.com/hmhsparkamind), stunning&nbsp;[nature](__notset__)[photography](https://www.bwpawards.org/), and&nbsp;[Rebecca Solnit](http://lithub.com/how-to-be-a-writer-10-tips-from-rebecca-solnit/)&nbsp;whipping writers (and artists of any stripe) into shape.
<br>
<br>Have a great week, folks!&nbsp;
