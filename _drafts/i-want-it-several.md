This week when I was shelving, I watched a toddler gather several copies of Sandra Boynton's *Eek Halloween!* and solemnly carry them across the children's department to the round table, where her mother was waiting.

"We can read these--Oh, I see you got the same book twice," she said. (If you're this customer, by the way--your baby is just great.)

This happens *a lot* in our department. Especially three and unders find great satisfaction in picking up huge fistfuls of the same titles. Sometimes they will walk away with one copy and then go back for more, one copy after the next. (Sometimes they are lost in transit and make a small trail on the floor, but the obvious intent is HAVE EVERYTHING.)

Maybe this is about color or shape or familiarity, but the key point is, their parents are patiently explaining that it's all the same book, and *they do not care*. If there is only one cool book in the world, they want the *ultimate amount of that book*.

I have on a lot more than one occasion seen

-kids want to buy books they've read before

-kids want to pick up MANY of the same book

-joey graceffa fans give the best gifts and care the most

-kids don't read like adults do

-kids aren't fans like adults are

-kid reading is special, kids love things is special

It's easy for us to get tired of hearing the same thing over and over. I am sure that plenty of parents out there can give me the world's longest stare because they, not I, have read *The Little Blue Truck* two hundred times this week. I'm kidless. I don't get to comment on the exhaustion--and it makes perfect sense that when a family comes to the bookstore, the parents are the ones who please, please, please want to read something that they don't have at home.

<br>Adults read differently. It's not uncommon, among our returns and used book buybacks, to receive books from customers because the (adult) customer has read it before. Sometimes it's because the book was a gift, but sometimes someone has simply read a book, mostly forgotten it, and then accidentally bought the same book again. And they don't want it twice.

That's a fine way to read, but kids don't read that way. They latch onto specific stories, sometimes inexplicably, sometimes to the chagrin of their adults. They read these books over and over, until the pages are covered in grime and start to fall out.
