There is an amazing moment as a bookseller when those new titles that you have been waiting and waiting and waiting for FINALLY come out of the box and hit the shelf. I always get a rush of joy and satisfaction when I get to plop a big stack of a new favorite out for the world to see. The next challenge is to put those new books into as many customers hands as possible! A challenge a bookseller will rise to with gusto.

So.

Without further adieu, here are some of the latest titles that make my heart go thump thump thump.

![](/uploads/versions/bearpiano---x----298-400x---.jpg)[The Bear and the Piano by David Litchfield](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780544674547)&nbsp;(picture book)

---

If this cover doesn't grab you instantly and make you take a deep breath of awe, then the story will. Bear, as a cub, finds an old piano deep in the woods. He falls in love from the first"plonk" of the keys. As he grows so does his talent, and soon he is in the big city playing for huge audiences and making all the headlines. But Bear misses home, family, and friends, so he returns to the forest. He was afraid he had been forgotten, but instead Bear finds everyone waiting to hear of his adventures and welcome him back with open arms.&nbsp;

At heart I think Litchfield is saying follow your dreams, take a chance and go as far as you can. Family and friends who love you will always be there waiting to hear about all you have learned. Truly beautiful!

![](/uploads/versions/wild-robot---x----269-400x---.jpg)[The Wild Robot by Peter Brown](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316381994)&nbsp;(middle grade fiction)

---

As soon as I saw this arrived I grabbed a copy for myself and practically ran for the front desk to buy it. Clutching it with joy the whole way. Truly! You might know Peter Brown from his great picture books, (which include [Curious Garden](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316015479)&nbsp;, [Mr. Tiger Goes Wild](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316200639)&nbsp;, [My Teacher is a Monster (No I'm Not)](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780316070294), and many more) but this book, it is something so very special. It is Brown's debut into Middle Grade! I could go on all day about how VERY VERY much I love this book. But all you need to know is this:

Robots, wildlife, adventure, illustrations (by Peter Brown of course!) and a WHOLE lot of heart are in this book. Seriously, check it out.&nbsp;

[Booked by Kwame Alexander](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780544570986)&nbsp;(middle grade)

---

Kwame Alexander knocked us out with his Newbery Award winning novel [The Crossover](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780544107717). Proving to be a master of the novel-in-verse, Alexander is back to take our breath away as we meet soccer star Nick Hall. So many kids are looking for books about sports. It is SUCH a pleasure to put Alexander's books in their hands and know that they are not only going to read a book on a topic they want, but they are going to read some incredible literature as well. Because Alexander is giving us so much more than a sports story. He is giving us diverse novels full of REAL LIFE. Not reality stretched a bit to make a good story, but a story that feels like you lived a day in someone else's shoes and you are a bigger person for it.
