One of the greatest burdens of being a bookseller is the frantic need to keep up with every single book that comes out. We're extremely lucky to get advanced copies of books so that we can recommend them as soon as they hit the shelves but that also means as we're discovering new books coming out we're already thinking of some that aren't out for a couple of months yet. As far as burdens go it's not a bad one, but it doesn't leave much time to reread old favorites or refresh ourselves on the previous book in a series.

My solution to that, I mean, aside from giving up sleeping which everyone tells me is a bad idea, is to “reread” books through the audio book. Generally speaking, I'll only listen to the audiobook if I've already read the print book. I think this is perfect for a number of reasons.

1. I walk to work and since my coordination borders on being nonexistent, I can't read and walk at the same time. Audiobooks let me do essentially that without stopping me from seeing where I'm going.
   <br>
   <br>2. Since I'm not crazy enough to own a car in Boston I take public transit to get places and, as anyone who takes it knows, public transit can get LOUD. Since I've already read the book I'm not worried about missing anything.
   <br>
   <br>3. I catch different things when listening to a book than I do when reading it so sometimes the audio book is like experiencing the book for the first time all over again.
   <br>
   <br>4. I don't mind looking a bit odd when I'm walking by myself and laughing at what appears to be nothing.


<br>When it was suggested that the Booksmith partner with Libro.fm to provide a source for digital audiobooks. I was ecstatic. Yes. Brilliant. More sources for audiobooks. I will take them.
<br>
<br>It's pretty easy too, which is glorious.

<br>**[Illuminae](https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781101916636-illuminae) by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff**
<br>
<br>When their planet is attacked out of nowhere, Kady and Ezra become refugees at the mercy of the fleet that saved them and their attackers who are still following. To complicate matters, a deadly virus has broken out on one of the ships and the fleet's AI has started making decisions of its own.
<br>
<br>If you know anything about Illuminae you're probably raising your eyebrows at me. I know the look, I've seen the look when I've brought this up before. If you don't know anything about Illuminae, the look comes from the fact that Illuminae is a really design-heavy book.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>![](/uploads/versions/illuminae-search-result-compressor---x----1642-688x---.png)&nbsp;(This is a screencap of a google image search for the book. That is actually what many of the pages look like.)
<br>
<br>So, I mean, skepticism is understandable. BUT! This audio book is MIND-BLOWINGLY good. Seriously amazing. It's full cast and the narrators are all expertly chosen. They're witty and wondrous and the voice of AIDEN is brilliantly artificial.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>I had read the book more than once before I picked up the audio and I still almost walked into traffic\* because I was too busy listening to it. So, maybe just walk around the block or something but LISTEN TO THIS ONE.
<br>
<br>\*Don't do this.&nbsp;

<br>[The Raven Cycle](https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9780545530491-raven-boys-the-book-1-of-the-raven-cycle)&nbsp;by Maggie Stiefvater
<br>
<br>My love for Maggie Stiefvater is well known in the store and this is the series of hers that I have a tattoo from so it might seem like that makes me predisposed to liking the audio. That's not exactly true. Tt makes me WANT to like the audio more but it also makes me way pickier about it. The narrator has to be just right. With a series as dark and magical as The Raven Cycle with a setting that's so vitally important to the story the narrator is REALLY important.
<br>
<br>The narrator for The Raven Cycle is Will Patton. If you spend enough time watching movies (or IMDBing them) you might be going 'oh...' if not look him up, I'll wait here a second.
<br>....
<br>Great. Yes, [that guy](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001599/).&nbsp;
<br>
<br>I'll admit that I didn't love him as the narrator at first but the odds of me loving any narrator right off the bat wasn't great.
