One of the greatest burdens of being a bookseller is the frantic need to keep up with every single book that comes out. We're extremely lucky to get advanced copies of books so that we can recommend them as soon as they hit the shelves but that also means as we're discovering new books coming out we're already thinking of some that aren't out for a couple of months. As far as burdens go it's not a bad one, it doesn't leave much time to reread old favorites or refresh ourselves on the previous book in a series.

My solution to that, I mean, aside from giving up sleeping which everyone tells me is a bad idea, is to “reread” books through the audio book. Generally speaking, I'll only listen to the audiobook if I've already read the print book. I think this is perfect for a number of reasons.
<br>

1. I walk to work and since my coordination borders on being nonexistent, I can't read and walk at the same time. Audiobooks let me do essentially that without stopping me from seeing where I'm going.
   <br>
   <br>2. Since I'm not crazy enough to own a car in Boston, I take public transit to get places and, as anyone who takes it knows, public transit can get LOUD. Since I've already read the book I'm not worried about missing anything.
   <br>
   <br>3. I catch different things when listening to a book than I do when reading it.
   <br>
   <br>4. I don't mind looking a bit odd when I'm walking by myself and laughing.


<br>When it was suggested that the Booksmith partner with Libro.fm to provide a source for digital audiobooks. I was ecstatic. Yes. Brilliant. More sources for audiobooks. I will take them.
<br>
<br>It's pretty easy too, which is glorious.
