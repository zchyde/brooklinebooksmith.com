**ANCIENT HISTORY: Boswell's [*Life of Johnson*](http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780199540211)**

I grew up in a house that held books in every room. There was no opt-out feature for rooms that did not wish to contain books. Bathrooms participated in book-holding by virtue of being rooms in the house where we lived. Bathroom reading was therefore a regular fact of life.

For years, my family kept an edition of Boswell’s *Life of Johnson* in the bathroom. No–the past tense isn’t right. As far as I know, that *Life of Johnson* is still there. There is a lot of *Life of Johnson* to get through.

If you are the average American in 2016, you may not know a lot about eighteenth-century historical figures who did not feature in *Hamilton*. (This is probably not your fault. The non-Revolutionary eighteenth century basically doesn’t exist in anyone’s curriculum.) Samuel Johnson was a sage of his age, a choleric middle-eighteenth-century Londoner who had a lot of opinions and wrote a dictionary, which made him famous to a lot of people for a long time. He was a kind of grumpy British Ben Franklin. Ben Franklin, on the other hand, was an American Samuel Johnson whose quips were slightly less vicious and who would have liked to be British, except that he failed about as drastically as you can.

Boswell (of *‘s Life* fame) was a guy who followed Johnson around all the time writing down everything about Johnson’s life, because he thought Johnson was literally the best person ever created. His vast biography is an excellent resource if you want to know really everything about Samuel Johnson, or if you really like reading published gossipy diaries starring the creme de la creme of a bygone but awkwardly familiar era, or if you want to be reading the same book in your bathroom fifteen years from now.

**BATHROOM READING**

I feel like reading in the bathroom has gone out of vogue in the last few years.

It was definitely a thing. People talked about it. People did read in bathrooms. They had that entire series of huge paperback *Uncle John’s Bathroom Reader*anthologies, which featured everything from history lessons to themed jokes. We can’t get those for you now. They were great, and now we can’t get them. Bathroom reading is in crisis! I’m here to remind you of its value–precious page time, sneaked in during moments which you are otherwise, one might say, wasting.

So, to be fair, finding the perfect reading material is tricky. Bathroom reading has got to be consistently engrossing within the first couple lines–any given two lines, in the entire book, because who knows where you are going to stop reading? Your book has got to be interesting enough that you always want to read it, yet digestible enough that you can quit in the middle of a sentence and pick it up later unphased. It also helps if a book has a lot of narrative breaks so you feel like you’re actually getting somewhere in something you spend one million hours reading in tiny increments. Ideally, it’s also something you don’t mind leaving in a bathroom.

Basically, your bathroom reading has to be some kind of obscene superbook held to standards no book can possibly achieve.

BOOKS THAT HAVE SUCCEEDED, HISTORICALLY SPEAKING, PART I

SCIENCE FICTION BOOK TALKS: Jo Walton’s What Makes This Book So Great

http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780765331946

I love Jo Walton. LOVE Jo Walton. If you haven’t read any of her novels, they tend to feel like compelling historical fiction with a wrench thrown into the working of the world that’s so large you hardly feel the changes. Among Others is about a lonely girl in a science fiction book club who talks to faeries who aren’t like any other fairies I’ve read about, who is very afraid to think that her will has forced other people’s emotions to obey her. My Real Children is about an old woman who remembers two lives–one where she marries a certain man, and one where she leaves him and spends her life with a woman instead, while in the background Walton casually drops bombs and builds elevators to the moon.

Her characters like to talk about books, so I bought this collection of essays (previously published as blog posts on Tor.com) in which she rereads some of her SF favorites (and, pleasingly, least favorites). Here is the thing: there is maybe a 5% crossover rate between books Jo Walton wants to read thirty times and books I do. But she’s tremendously interesting when she talks about books, and the incidental effect of reading this book is that, if you have a preference for newer SF/F like me, you will suddenly know a whole lot more about the history of the genre than you did before. If you know the old canon and its oddballs, as well, you’ll have someone to commiserate or argue with. Either way, at a few pages a post, it’s a great book to have sitting under the towel rack.

IT’S LIKE A HEALTH BOOK BUT FUN TO READ: A.J. Jacobs’s Drop Dead Healthy

http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9781416599081

A.J. Jacobs specializes in obsessive year long projects that make extremely edible, also humorous, bite-sized and interesting reading. In The Know-It-All http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780743250627, he sets out to read the entirety of the Encyclopedia Britannica. In The Year of Living Biblically http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780743291484, he starts obeying as literally as possible every law in the Bible.

I’m a particular fan of Drop Dead Healthy, however, because in it he takes as universal an approach to improving his physical and mental wellbeing as possible, trying out every method of exercise, diet, philosophy and therapy that I would personally never in one million years commit to. There’s a great deal of pleasure to be had in reading about all of these things through someone who a) isn’t you and b) hasn’t either died or lost his sense of humor because of all the bizarre rigors of his extreme wellness adventuring. You may also learn that the wierdest way you ever heard of for taking care of yourself is not in fact the wierdest way people have come up with. Humans are really good at coming up with weird stuff. It’s one of our things.

SCIENCE WITH STICK FIGURES IN FOUR PAGES OR LESS: Randall Munroe’s *What If?*

http://www.brooklinebooksmith-shop.com/book/9780544272996

One of the weird stuffs that humans are good at coming up with: science questions. Strangely posed, potentially fatal, sometimes worrying science questions. The questions in What If? were sent to stick figure web cartoonist Randall Monroe’s special science question email address. And he answers them! His answers are illustrated in Monroe’s classic stick style (as you may recognize from *XKCD*), and include a few familiar characters, but without any awareness of his comics, and even if the drawings were brutally Sharpie’d out of your copy, you’d be left with a fascinating, zippy, funny, and very clever book. Each section is only a few pages long, and is pretty much appropriate for everyone who’s old enough to absorb the explanations. Not a lot of popular science books are this darn fun.

The American paperback edition has yet to exist–the hardcover is gorgeous but, admittedly, not ideal bathroom reading material. But it’s so ideal for the purpose that it might be worth breaking the rules–and, if you have a keen eye and a quick hand, we still have a few copies of the British paperback edition on our bargain table.

Stay tuned for part 2.
