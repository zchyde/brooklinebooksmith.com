Over Easter Week 1916, around 1,600 Irish people rose against Britain’s political rule of Ireland and seized control of key parts of Dublin. The anniversary will be celebrated over this year’s Easter weekend, March 26-27. And some really cool books, some using entirely new or ignored material, have been published as part of the centennial. Whether you are interested in a really complicated history that is often undiscussed in the U.S. or continuing St. Patty’s Day celebrations, you may want to take a look.

A little bit of background for the unfamiliar:

The five-day span that has come to be known as the Easter Rising (alternately the Easter Rebellion) was a pivotal event in the long, tumultuous struggle surrounding the question Ireland’s independence. The participants in the Easter Rising were a coalition of various factions - Irish Republican Brotherhood, Irish Civilian Army, Cunmann na mBan - who gained control of Dublin briefly. The British retaliated and more than 2,000 people were wounded or killed. In the aftermath, thousands were jailed and the leaders were executed. The success of the rebels in capturing control of Dublin and the violent response of the British is a key to understanding the process resulting in the declaration of the independent Republic of Ireland on Easter Monday, 1949.
