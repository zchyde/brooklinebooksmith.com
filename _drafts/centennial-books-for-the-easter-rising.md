Over Easter Week 1916, around 1,600 Irish people rose against Britain’s political rule of Ireland and seized control of key parts of Dublin. The five-day span that has come to be known as the Easter Rising (alternately the Easter Rebellion) was a pivotal event in the long, tumultuous struggle surrounding the question of Ireland’s independence. The participants in the Easter Rising were a coalition of various factions - Irish Republican Brotherhood, Irish Civilian Army, Cunmann na mBan - who gained control of Dublin briefly. The British retaliated and more than 2,000 people were wounded or killed. In the aftermath, thousands were jailed and the leaders were executed. The success of the rebels in capturing control of Dublin and the violent response of the British is a key to understanding the process eventually resulting in the declaration of the independent Republic of Ireland on Easter Monday, 1949.

Whether you are interested in a really complicated history that is often undiscussed in the U.S. or continuing St. Paddy’s Day celebrations of Irish heritage, you may want to take a look at these centennial books on our shelves.
