On a recent early morning commute I counted seven out of twelve people in my train car openly carrying and reading a book. I can attest that I felt an overwhelming sense of safety and patriotic pride. Take a peek at some [street art](http://ebookfriendly.com/books-libraries-in-street-art/) which celebrates reading in public.

[Here](http://lithub.com/contemplating-the-infinite-with-annie-dillard/) and [here](http://publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/profiles/article/69767-a-new-take-on-race.html) are profiles of a pair of prodigious readers; one of them a living legend and the other a bright new star. The link between Annie Dillard and Kaitlyn Greenidge (whose debut novel [We Love You, Charlie Freeman](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/18/books/review-we-love-you-charlie-freeman-kaitlyn-greenidges-debut-novel.html?_r=0) is an immediate staff favorite) is that the ocean of books they've read does not keep them pleasurably submerged, as it might me, but lifts them up high on swells from which they can see far horizons hidden from the rest of us. You ought to check out this excellent [essay](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/opinion/sunday/my-mothers-garden.html) by Greenidge about the harm and hollowness of objectivity…but first [go play with this](http://www.kmhcreative.com/labs/demos/MondriPong/index.html).

Our events series brings [Augusten Burroughs](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-04/augusten-burroughs-lust--wonder-a-memoir/) in a couple weeks, and a whole lot more - including the amazing portrait photography of [Rania Matar](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/events/2016-03/rania-matar-lenfant-femme/) - in between.

And if mine is the only Booksmith voice you listen to, you are depriving yourself. Over on our [blog](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/blog/) we've got booksellers covering everything from literary [legal](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/2016/03/21/this-week-in-books-google-seals-the-deal/)wars to [fracking.](http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/2016/03/29/lets-talk-about-fracking/)
