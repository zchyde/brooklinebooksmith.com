An intimate chronicle of a time and place few have experienced; in warm, precise prose, Carhart reconstructs the wonders of his childhood as an American in postwar France. His firsthand account brings to life nothing less than France in the 1950s, from the parks and museums of Paris to the rigors of French schooling to the vast ch√¢teau of Fontainebleau and its village. *Finding Fontainebleau* is for those captivated by the French way of life, for armchair travelers, and for anyone who has ever fallen in love with a place they want to visit over and over again.
