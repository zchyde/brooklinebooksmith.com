Richard Russo returns to North Bath and the characters who made *Nobody’s Fool* “a big, rambunctious novel with endless riffs and unstoppable human hopefulness” (*The Boston Globe*). *Everybody’s Fool* is filled with humor, heart, hard times and people you can’t help but love, possibly because their various faults make them so stridently human. This is classic Russo—and a crowning achievement from one of the greatest storytellers of our time.
