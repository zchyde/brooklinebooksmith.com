Join us for a discussion on perspective in fiction and to celebrate Michelle Hoover’s new novel Bottomland. Told in the voices of the family patriarch and his children, Bottomland follows the Hess family in the years after World War I as they attempt to rid themselves of the Anti-German sentiment that left a stain on their name. Christopher Castellani, an award-winning novelist and the artistic director of GrubStreet, will join Michelle to discuss his new nonfiction book, The Art of Perspective, a fascinating discussion on what form a narrator in literature should take.
