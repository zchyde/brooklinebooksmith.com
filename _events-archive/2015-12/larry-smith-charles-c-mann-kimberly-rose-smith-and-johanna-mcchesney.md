In 2006 Larry Smith challenged readers to tell their story in just six words, calling the form the Six-Word Memoir. Smith is back again with *The Best Advice in Six Words*, a poignant collection of universal wisdom, life lessons, and caution thrown to the wind. With contributions from the likes of Molly Ringwald, Lemony Snicket, and Gary Shteyngart, readers will be pulled into the sometimes hilarious, often serious, often reflective experience of the book. Join Larry Smith as he talks about the Six-Word Memoir project, hosts a reading by contributors Charles C. Mann, Kimberly Rose Smith, and Johanna McChesney, and leads audience members to share their own six-word memoirs!
