When Olivia Rawlings—pastry chef for an exclusive Boston dinner club—sets not just her flambéed dessert but the entire building alight, she escapes to the most comforting place she can think of—the idyllic town of Guthrie, Vermont. But the getaway turns into something more lasting when the owner of the Sugar Maple Inn offers Livvy a job. Broke and knowing that her days at the club are numbered, Livvy accepts. But then another new arrival takes the community by surprise, and Livvy must decide whether to do what she does best and flee—or stay and finally discover what it means to belong.
