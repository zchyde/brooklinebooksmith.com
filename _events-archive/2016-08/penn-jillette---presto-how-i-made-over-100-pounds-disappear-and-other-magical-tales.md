Legendary magician Penn Jillette was approaching his sixtieth birthday topping 330 pounds. He knew he was at a dangerous crossroads. And then came Crazy Ray. A former NASA scientist and an unconventional, passionate innovator, Ray Cronise saved Penn Jillette’s life with his wild “potato diet.” In *Presto*, Jillette takes us along on his journey from skepticism to the inspiring, life-changing momentum that transformed the magician’s body and mind.
