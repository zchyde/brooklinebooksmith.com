Following on the heels of his *New York Times*-bestselling novel Telegraph Avenue, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Chabon delivers, *Moonglow* the deathbed confession of a man the narrator refers to only as “my grandfather.” It is a tale of madness, of war and adventure, of sex and marriage and desire, of existential doubt and model rocketry. It is also a tour de force of speculative autobiography in which Chabon devises and reveals a secret history of his own imagination. *Moonglow* is Chabon at his most moving and inventive.
