When Olivia Laing (*The Trip to Echo Spring*) moved to New York City in her mid-thirties, she found herself inhabiting loneliness on a daily basis. Increasingly fascinated by this most shameful of experiences, she began to explore the lonely city by way of art. Moving fluidly between works and lives—from Edward Hopper’s *Nighthawks* to Andy Warhol’s *Time Capsules*—Laing conducts an electric, dazzling investigation into what it means to be alone.
