From internationally bestselling author Tracy Chevalier *(Girl with a Pearl Earring*), comes a riveting drama of a pioneer family on the American frontier. 1838: James and Sadie Goodenough and their five children work relentlessly to tame their patch of land, buying saplings from a local tree man known as John Appleseed. 1853: Their youngest child Robert is haunted, wandering through Gold Rush California. In the redwood and giant sequoia groves he finds some solace, collecting seeds for a naturalist.  But you can run only so far, even in America, and when Robert’s past makes an unexpected appearance he must decide whether to strike out again or stake his own claim to a home at last.
