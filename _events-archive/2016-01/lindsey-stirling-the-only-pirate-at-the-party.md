A classically trained musician gone rogue, Lindsey Stirling is the epitome of independent, success: after being voted off the set of “America’s Got Talent,” she went on to record two full-length albums, release multiple hits with billions of YouTube views, and tour sold-out venues across the world. Lindsey’s magnetizing story testifies that there is no single recipe for success, and despite what people may say, sometimes it’s okay to be *The Only Pirate at the Party*.
