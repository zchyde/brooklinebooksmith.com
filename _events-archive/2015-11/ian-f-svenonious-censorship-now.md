In this outrageous and hilarious new essay collection, underground music icon Ian F. Svenonius tackles such diverse subjects as IKEA, Apple, the weather, the gentrification of punk by indie rock, Christian pornography, vampires, hoarding, the role of sugar in empire-building, and how to properly tip at restaurants. No one is left unscathed, and more than a few will be left scratching their heads even as they laugh.
