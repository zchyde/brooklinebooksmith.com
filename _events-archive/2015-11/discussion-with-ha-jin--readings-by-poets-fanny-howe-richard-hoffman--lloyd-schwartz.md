In honor of the 70th anniversary this year of the liberation of the Nazi camps, the Terezin Music Foundation’s director Mark Ludwig invited some of the world’s top contemporary voices to write poems on the theme of freedom for the anthology LIBERATION.

The LIBERATION anthology presents 82 new poems by 63 poets from 25 countries writing about political, personal, and artistic freedom. Terezin Music Foundation set some of these poems to music; we'll listen as we hear these great poets read. LIBERATION "will hearten those who have lived long, and inspire young readers to strive for understanding, celebration of our differences, and peace." —Ruth Bader Ginsberg.

**This event will be held at Brookline Booksmith. Tickets are not required.**
