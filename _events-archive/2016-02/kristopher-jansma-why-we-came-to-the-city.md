Kristopher Jansma’s award-winning debut novel, *The Unchangeable Spots of Leopards*, was praised for its “wry humor” and “charmingly unreliable narrator” in *The New Yorker* and Jansma has been hailed as “F. Scott Fitzgerald meets Wes Anderson” by The Village Voice. In *Why We Came to the City*, Jansma offers an unforgettable exploration of friendships forged in the fires of ambition, passion, hope, and love. This glittering story of a generation coming of age is a sweeping, poignant triumph.
