Based on a true story, *Girl Waits with Gun* introduced us to Constance Kopp and her charming and steadfast sisters. *Lady Cop Makes Trouble* sets Constance loose on the streets of New York City and New Jersey--tracking down victims, trailing leads, and making friends as she forges her own path, tackling crime and nefarious criminals along the way.
