Set in the Chinese city of Nanjing during the time of the Sino-Japanese war (1937-1945), this novel tells the story of four people caught up in the violence and tumult. When the Japanese invade there is no safe place in the city and each must try to survive against the odds. Vivid and disturbing, *Nanjing Never Cries* offers a compelling story of the horror of war and the power of love and friendship.
