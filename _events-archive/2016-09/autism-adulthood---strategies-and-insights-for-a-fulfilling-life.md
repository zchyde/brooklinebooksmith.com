Told in Senator’s trademark warm, honest, and approachable style, *Autism Adulthood* paints a vivid and thought-provoking picture of many people grappling with grown-up, real-life autism. Featuring thirty interviews with autistic adults, their parents, caregivers, researchers, and professionals, Senator’s is the only book of its kind, as real families share their stories and their creative solutions. From her own son with autism, now twenty-five, she has learned “never say never.”
