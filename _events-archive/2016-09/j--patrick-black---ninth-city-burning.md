Entire cities disappeared in the blink of an eye, leaving nothing but dust and rubble. When an alien race came to make Earth theirs, they brought with them a weapon we had no way to fight. Five hundred years later, the Earth is locked in a grinding war of attrition. But the enemy’s tactics are changing, and Earth’s defenders are about to discover this centuries-old war has only just begun.
