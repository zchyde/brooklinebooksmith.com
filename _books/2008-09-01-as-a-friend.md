Set in a rural landscape as vivid as its characters, *As a Friend* tells the story of a gifted young man, a land surveyor, whose impact on those around him provokes intense self-examination and charged eroticism. With poetic insight, Gander explores the nature of attraction, betrayal, and loyalty. Beautifully written and suffused with a pastoral nostalgia, *As a Friend* is brilliant in style and unsettling.
