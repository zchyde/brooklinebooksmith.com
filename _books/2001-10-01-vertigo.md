*Vertigo* is the marvelous first novel by W.G. Sebald: "The most exciting, and most mysteriously sublime, of contemporary European writers" (James Wood, *The New Republic*). An unnamed narrator, beset by nervous ailments, journeys across Europe to Vienna, Venice, Verona, Riva, and finally to his childhood home in a small Bavarian village. He is also journeying into the past. Traveling in the footsteps of Stendhal, Casanova and Kafka, the narrator draws the reader line by line into a dizzying web of history, biography, autobiography, legends, literature, and — most perilously — memories.
