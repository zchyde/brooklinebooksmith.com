Veronica, Pontius Pilate's wife, is beautiful, brilliant, and weary of her worldly life. One day she disguises herself as a servant in order to visit a fortune-teller, and when the seer, Mnevis, tells her of a Jew, a "love-god," Veronica suddenly feels alive, experiencing "sudden pre-visions of inner splendor." Jesus arouses the artist, the dreamer in her––this prophet who believes women have an important place in the spiritual hierarchy. What follows is a chain of events in which Veronica commits the one genuine act of her life, daringly offering Jesus a "way out" of his crucifixion. This revision of biblical history––in the tradition of D.H. Lawrence's *The Man Who Died* and Kazantzakis's *The Last Temptation of Christ*––is not just a novel; it is part of the ongoing dialogue about the feminine and divine.* Pilate’s Wife* was written by H.D. in 1929 and revised in 1934, and is now finally in print, edited with an introduction by H.D. scholar Joan A. Burke. It is without question a testament to Alicia Ostriker's claim that, among the women writers of this century, "H.D. is the most profoundly religious, the most seriously engaged in spiritual quest."
