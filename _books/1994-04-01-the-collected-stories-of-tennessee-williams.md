Tennessee Williams' *Collected Stories* combines the four short-story volumes published during Williams' lifetime with previously unpublished or uncollected stories. Arranged chronologically, the forty-nine stories, when taken together with the memoir of his father that serves as a preface, not only establish Williams as a major American fiction writer of the twentieth century, but also, in Gore Vidal's view, constitute the real autobiography of Williams' "art and inner life."
