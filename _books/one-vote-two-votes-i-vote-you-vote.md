The Cat in the Hat looks at how we vote, why we vote, and who we vote for&nbsp;
<br>
<br>In simple rhyme, the Cat in the Hat introduces early readers to the concept and practice of voting with a focus on the American presidency Learn the basic principles of democracy, how political parties are formed, why Election Day is held in early November, and much, much more An ideal choice for reading and talking about elections (whether for a classroom pet or the leader of the free world), this is also perfect for supporting the Common Core State Standards. Fans of the hit PBS show The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That will be delighted to see the Cat knows as much about history and civic responsibility as he does about science
