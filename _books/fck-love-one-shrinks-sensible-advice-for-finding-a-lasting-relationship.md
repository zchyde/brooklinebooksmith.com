From the brilliant New York Times bestselling authors of the refreshingly blunt (Harper's Bazaar) F\*ck Feelings this seriously irreverent roadmap reveals the essentials to look for when you're done being suckered by the promise of true love and want help seeking a real, lasting relationship.&nbsp;
<br>Many people have opinions on the subject of romantic relationships why they re so hard to find, so difficult to maintain, so easily analogized to planets and pets but the real source of trouble isn t too complicated: it's that we are choosing our partners based on love, excitement, lust, attraction, neediness on feelings.&nbsp;
<br>Instead of helping readers find true love (also known as total bullshit ), Dr. Michael Bennett and his comedy-writing daughter Sarah reveal the practical, commonsense criteria for good partnerships that will allow real love to develop, even after the romance has died down or been buried completely. Finding a good partner involves losing preconceived notions about who your dream date might be, so the Bennetts helpfully appraise the pros and cons of eight traits people most commonly seek: charisma, beauty, chemistry, communication, sense of humor, family stability, intelligence, and wealth. They suggest you ll have better luck finding a partner in a bar, online, or on a date arranged by your chiropractor if you focus on ideas like mutual attraction and respect and common interests and common goals. With helpful quizzes, case studies inspired by Dr. Bennett's practice, and unscientific flow charts, F\*ck Love is packed with enough advice and wisdom to help you avoid the relationship nightmares that led you to this book in the first place.
