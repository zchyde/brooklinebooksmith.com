From award-winning author Sharon Draper comes "Out of My Mind, "the story of a brilliant girl who cannot speak or write.&nbsp;
<br>"If there is one book teens and parents (and everyone else) should read this year, Out of My Mind should be it" (Denver Post).&nbsp;
<br>Melody is not like most people. She cannot walk or talk, but she has a photographic memory; she can remember every detail of everything she has ever experienced. She is smarter than most of the adults who try to diagnose her and smarter than her classmates in her integrated classroom--the very same classmates who dismiss her as mentally challenged, because she cannot tell them otherwise. But Melody refuses to be defined by cerebral palsy. And she's determined to let everyone know it...somehow.&nbsp;
<br>In this breakthrough story--reminiscent of "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"--from multiple Coretta Scott King Award-winner Sharon Draper, readers will come to know a brilliant mind and a brave spirit who will change forever how they look at anyone with a disability.
