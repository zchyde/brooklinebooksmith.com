*Never Love a Gambler *is a showcase for the exceptional talents of Keith Ridgway. The *Times *(London) praised his stories as “flawlessly structured yarns told in lovingly crafted prose.” Ridgway’s characters negotiate their way through love, madness, lust, anger, religious obsession, crime, and absence in stories told with innovative mastery and brightened by fiercely vivid dialogues. *Never Love a Gambler* is a mental rust-remover: refreshing, bracing, and often violently funny.
