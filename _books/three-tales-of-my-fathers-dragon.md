The classic fantasy trilogy of Elmer Elevator and the flying baby dragon has delighted children and their parents for generations. Now, on the occasion of their fiftieth anniversary, Random House is proud to bring the three timeless tales together in one beautiful commemorative edition, complete with the original delightful illustrations.A Newbery Honor Book and an ALA Notable Book, My Father's Dragon is followed by Elmer and the Dragon ("rich, humorous, and thoroughly satisfying"\*) and The Dragons of Blueland ("ingenious and plausible, the fantasy well-sustained"\*).Each story stands alone, but read in succession, they are an unforgettable experience.\*Library Journal, starred review.
