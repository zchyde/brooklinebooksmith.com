A Russian train which makes no stops, the *Yellow Arrow* has no end and no beginning, and its destination is a ruined bridge. Andrei, less and less lulled by the never-ending hum of the wheels, begins to look for a way to escape. But life in the carriages goes on as always. "Indifferent to their fate, the passengers carry on as usual––trading in nickel melted down from the carriage doors, attending the Upper Bunk avant-garde theatre, leafing through Pasternak’s *Early Trains*, or disposing of their dead through the compartment windows” (*The London Observer*).
