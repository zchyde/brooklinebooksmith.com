When it comes to infographics the best work in this field grabs those eyes, keeps them glued, and the grip is sensual and often immediate. A good graphic says See what I see and either you do or you don t. The best ones pull you right in, and won t let you go.&nbsp;
<br>From the introduction by Robert Krulwich
<br>

The Best American Infographics 2016 covers the realms of social issues, health, sports, arts and culture, and politics including crisp visual data on the likely Democratic/Republican leanings ofan array of professions (proving that your urologist is far more likely to be a Republican than your pediatrician). Here once again are the most innovative print and electronic infographics the full spectrum of the genre from authoritative to playful (Scientific American).ROBERT KRULWICH is the cohost of Radiolab and a science correspondent for NPR.
