Hailed by *Publishers Weekly* as “an A-1 satire on urban living,” William Herrick's *Bradovich* is now available as a New Directions paperbook. Stephen Bradovich––sculptor, widower, former pro ball player, sometime brawler. Why would this complexly human, anarchist protagonist receive a visit from two impassive, square-shouldered operatives with the alarmling news: "You are under surveillance pending review, that's the message The Authority sends you"? Praised for the compassion, humanism, and "truth-seeking" of his earlier novels, Herrick in *Bradovich *steps beyond the "lean and muscular prose" of his terrorist trilogy (*Shadows & Wolves*, *Love & Terror*, *Kill Memory*) and beyond the working-class realism that won The Present Tense/Joel H. Cavior Award for *That's Life* (in 1985) to a surreal––if still recognizable––New York where suddenly not only the improbable but the impossible can happen.
