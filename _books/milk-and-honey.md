Milk and Honey is a collection of poetry and prose about survival. About the experience of violence, abuse, love, loss, and femininity.&nbsp;
<br>The book is divided into four chapters, and each chapter serves a different purpose. Deals with a different pain. Heals a different heartache. Milk and Honey takes readers through a journey of the most bitter moments in life and finds sweetness in them because there is sweetness everywhere if you are just willing to look.
