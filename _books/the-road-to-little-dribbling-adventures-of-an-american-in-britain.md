In 1995, Iowa native Bill Bryson took a motoring trip around Britain to explore that green and pleasant land. The uproarious book that resulted, Notes from a Small Island, is one of the most acute portrayals of the United Kingdom ever written. Two decades later, Bryson now a British citizen set out again to rediscover his adopted country. In these pages, he follows a straight line through the island from Bognor Regis to Cape Wrath and shows us every pub, stone village, and human foible along the way.&nbsp;
<br>Whether he is dodging cow attacks in Torcross, getting lost in the H&M on Kensington High Street, or more seriously contemplating the future of the nation's natural wonders in the face of aggressive development, Bryson guides us through the old and the new with vivid detail and laugh-out-loud humor. Irreverent, endearing, and always hilarious, The Road to Little Dribbling is filled with Bill Bryson's deep knowledge and love of his chosen home.
