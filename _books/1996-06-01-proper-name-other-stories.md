*Proper Name* collects for the first time the inimitable stories of Bernadette Mayer––"one of the most original writers of her generation" (*The Washington Post*). The nineteen narratives of *Proper Name *include "My Excellent Novel," "Ice Cube Epigrams," "Essay: How Carefully Do We Tend?" and "Juan Gave Nora a Pomegranate." Mayer's structural inventions are terrific and unique. As Fanny Howe remarked in *The American Book Review*, "In a language made up of idiom and lyricism, Mayer cancels the boundaries between prose and poetry."
