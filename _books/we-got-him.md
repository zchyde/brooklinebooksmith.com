Tensions run high in a blended Bostonian family as Sarah Stratidakis goes into labor with her first child. Enduring an tortuously long birth, Sarah is haunted by past events, including the recent Boston Marathon Bombing, the perpetrator of which bears a striking resemblance to her erratic and estranged stepson who has only just returned home.

“Elizabeth Searle’s We Got Him is an ingeniously plotted, suspenseful novel written in blood, mother’s milk, and the unintended consequence of rage. It is the story of one family’s inherited flaws, harbored guilts, and obsessive desires, whether for a child, a parent, or a second chance to do the elusive right thing. Powerfully worked against the unfolding evens of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, Elizabeth Searle’s taut drama of a young, pregnant stepmorther and her troubled stepson is a narrative tour de force, interweaving public and private acts of terror with the redemptive, but ever-fragile, forces of love.” –Melissa Pritchard, author of Palmerinoand &nbsp;A Solemn Pleasure.
