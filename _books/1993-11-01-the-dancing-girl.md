Written in 1790, Hasan Shah's autobiographical romance, *The Dancing Girl*, is remarkable for both its lyrical prose and its fine recreation of a time, a place, and a culture––India in the 1780s, a tolerant, affable era before the full establishment of British colonial rule. *The Dancing Girl* tells of the doomed love of Hasan Shah (aide-de-camp to a British officer) and Khanum Jan (a courageous and gifted dancer of the courtesan caste) whose secret marriage could not prevent their separation. At Khanum Jan's death, her grief-striken husband turned his raw emotion into a surprisingly modern, first-person narrative "without realizing," as leading Urdu novelist Qurratulain Hyder observes in the foreword to her translation (from the 1893 Urdu translation of the original Persian), "that he had become a pioneer of the modern Indian novel."
