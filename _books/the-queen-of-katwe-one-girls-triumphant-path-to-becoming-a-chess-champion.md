Soon to be a major motion picture starring Academy Award winner Lupita Nyong o and David Oyelowo, directed by Mira Nair.&nbsp;
<br>The astonishing (The New York Times Book Review) and inspirational (Shelf Awareness) true story of Phiona Mutesi a teenage chess prodigy from the slums of Uganda.&nbsp;
<br>One day in 2005 while searching for food, nine-year-old Ugandan Phiona Mutesi followed her brother to a dusty veranda where she met Robert Katende.&nbsp;
<br>Katende, a war refugee turned missionary, had an improbable dream: to empower kids in the Katwe slum through chess a game so foreign there is no word for it in their native language. Laying a chessboard in the dirt, Robert began to teach. At first children came for a free bowl of porridge, but many grew to love the game that like their daily lives requires persevering against great obstacles. Of these kids, one girl stood out as an immense talent: Phiona.&nbsp;
<br>By the age of eleven Phiona was her country's junior champion, and at fifteen, the national champion. Now a Woman Candidate Master the first female titled player in her country's history Phiona dreams of becoming a Grandmaster, the most elite level in chess. But to reach that goal, she must grapple with everyday life in one of the world's most unstable countries. The Queen of Katwe is a remarkable (NPR) and riveting (New York Post) book that shows how Phiona's story transcends the limitations of the chessboard (Robert Hess, US Grandmaster).
