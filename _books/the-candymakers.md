In the town of Spring Haven, four children have been selected to compete in the national candymaking contest of a lifetime. Who will make a candy more delicious than the Oozing Crunchorama or the Neon Yellow Lightning Chew?&nbsp;
<br>Logan, the candymaker's son, who can detect the color of chocolate by feel alone?&nbsp;
<br>Miles, the boy allergic to rowboats and the color pink?&nbsp;
<br>Daisy, the cheerful girl who can lift a fifty-pound lump of taffy as if it were a feather?&nbsp;
<br>Philip, the suit-and-tie-wearing boy who's always scribbling in a secret notebook?&nbsp;
<br>This sweet, charming, and cleverly crafted story, told from each contestant's perspective, is filled with mystery, friendship, and juicy revelations.
