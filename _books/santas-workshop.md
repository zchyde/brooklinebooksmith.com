Christmas is coming, it's time to take a trip to Santa's workshop and Christmas Town Pip and Pod the Elves are busy making toys, Mrs. Holly is selling delicious treats in the Christmas Candy Shop, and Santa is packing his sleigh with presents in this fabulously festive lift-the-flap board book. There are eight magical holiday scenes to explore, each with flaps to lift with fun Christmas surprises to discover underneath.
