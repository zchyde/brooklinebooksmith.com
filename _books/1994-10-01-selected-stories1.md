The stories, chosen from various collections published from the mid-'50s to the late '80s, is aptly divided into two parts, "The Labyrinth of Love" and "Adverse Miracles," ample frames for the author's amatory tales and wry magical realism. It is a fine introduction to one of Latin America's leading modern writers - and a choice retrospective of the master storyteller who won the 1990 Cervantes Prize, Spain's most prestigious literary award, for his lifetime work.
