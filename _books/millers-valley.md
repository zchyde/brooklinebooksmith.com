"NEW YORK TIMES "BESTSELLER In a small town on the verge of big change, a young woman unearths deep secrets about her family and unexpected truths about herself. Filled with insights that are the hallmark of Anna Quindlen's bestsellers, "Miller's Valley" is an emotionally powerful story about a family you will never forget.&nbsp;
<br>For generations the Millers have lived in Miller's Valley. Mimi Miller tells about her life with intimacy and honesty. As Mimi eavesdrops on her parents and quietly observes the people around her, she discovers more and more about the toxicity of family secrets, the dangers of gossip, the flaws of marriage, the inequalities of friendship and the risks of passion, loyalty, and love. Home, as Mimi begins to realize, can be a place where it's just as easy to feel lost as it is to feel content.&nbsp;
<br>"Miller's Valley" is a masterly study of family, memory, loss, and, ultimately, discovery, of finding true identity and a new vision of home. As Mimi says, No one ever leaves the town where they grew up, even if they go. "Miller's Valley" reminds us that the place where you grew up can disappear, and the people in it too, but all will live on in your heart forever.&nbsp;
