A soon-to-be siren finds herself responsible for the lives of her sisters and the fisherman they curse in this haunting debut novel.&nbsp;
<br>Now that I know the truth, I sometimes picture my sisters in headlights, the way they would have looked on that cold February night, armed with shovels and pickaxes, and digging in the graveyard.&nbsp;
<br>Lolly Salt has beautiful sisters. When they re not in school or running their small town's diner, they re secretly luring ships to their doom from the cliffs of Starbridge Cove, Maine. With beautiful voices that twelve-year-old Lolly has yet to grow into (not that she wants to anyway) the Salt sisters do the work mandated by the Sea Witch, a glamorously frightening figure determined to keep the girls under her control. With their mother dead after a terrible car crash, and their father drowning in his grief, the sisters carry on with their lives and duties until a local sea captain gets suspicious about the shipwrecks.&nbsp;
<br>On the day before her birthday, Lolly watches in helpless horror as her sisters are lured themselves by curse-reversing fishermen and suddenly it's up to her and her best friend Jason to rescue the sirens of Starbridge Cove.
