Vibrant and suspenseful . . . Like The Art Forger, this new story takes us into the heart of what it means to be an artist. The Washington Post
<br>
<br>B. A. Shapiro captivated us in 2012 with her addictive novel The Art Forger. Now, she's back with another thrilling tale from the art world. Entertainment Weekly
<br>
<br>When Alizee Benoit, an American painter working for the Works Progress Administration (WPA), vanishes in New York City in 1940, no one knows what happened to her. Not her Jewish family living in German-occupied France. Not her artistic patron and political compatriot, Eleanor Roosevelt. Not her close-knit group of friends, including Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock, and Lee Krasner. And, some seventy years later, not her great-niece, Danielle Abrams, who while working at Christie's auction house uncovers enigmatic paintings hidden behind works by those now-famous Abstract Expressionist artists. Do they hold answers to the questions surrounding her missing aunt?
