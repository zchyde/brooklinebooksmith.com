Master the techniques of making your perfect grain bowl&nbsp;
<br>Ancient grains are making their way back into the modern-day diet, which is great news for health-inspired home cooks. They have always been around, but now you can find bulgur wheat, freekeh, buckwheat, quinoas, rices, barley, farro, kamut, wheatberries, and spelt at your local market.&nbsp;
<br>Here are recipes for every appetite, including lighter fare such as salads, filling vegetarian (even vegan) meals, as well as heartier bowls with meat and seafood. There are one-pot recipes such as stews and risottos, as well as classic assembled grain bowls topped with dressings and sauces. All of them can be prepared in advance for quick, healthy weekday meals that are far from boring.&nbsp;
<br>Many of the dishes use gluten-free grains, such as buckwheat and rice. And grain bowl additions, such as fruits, vegetables and proteins are so adaptable that it is easy to eliminate or add items based on any fussy eaters in the family.
