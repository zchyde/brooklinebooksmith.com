An astonishing, even shocking debut written with both humor and heart by, as John Casey puts it, a natural-born writer who inhabits every one of his characters the good, the bad, and those who swing back and forth.&nbsp;
<br>Set in a bitterly benighted, mine-polluted corner of Virginia, "Nitro Mountain" follows a group of people bound together by alcohol, small-time crime and music. There's Leon, a hapless bass player who can embroil himself in trouble just by getting out of bed in the morning. And his would-be girlfriend, Jennifer, who's living with Arnett, the town's most dangerous thug and hoping Leon will help her poison him. And there's Arnett himself, a psychopath for the ages albeit so charming and deranged, so strikingly authentic, that he arrests the reader's attention at first sight and holds it fast. His mirror image, a singer-songwriter named Jones, has his own moral issues, though at least he s" trying" to be a good man. The bright if battered soul who pulls us through this story is Jennifer, a vulnerable yet strong woman struggling heroically to survive the endemic hopelessness and violence that have surrounded her since birth.&nbsp;
<br>Relentless? Yes, of course, but never remotely gratuitous. Every single moment is shot through with the pain and misery that inspire so much of the music these people love more than life itself.
