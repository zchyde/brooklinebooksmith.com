Paris, 1902: Renowned sculptor Auguste Rodin has just completed The Thinker. Rainer Maria Rilke is a delicate young visitor from Prague, broke and suffering from a case of writer's block. When Rilke is commissioned to write a book about Rodin, everything changes. . . .years together as master and disciple, their heartbreaking rift, and ultimately their moving reconciliation. In her vibrant debut, Rachel Corbett reveals how Rodin's influence led Rilke to write his most celebrated poems and inspired his belovedLetters to a Young Poet. She captures the dawn of modernism with appearances by Paul Cezanne, Henri Matisse, Lou Andreas-Salome, George Bernard Shaw, and Jean Cocteau. And she recounts the remarkable friendship of two extraordinary artists whose work continues to reverberate a century later.
