Slippery figures in anomalous situations – ghosts, spies, bodyguards, criminals – haunt these stories by Javier Marías: the characters come bearing their strange and special secrets, and never leave our minds. In one story, a man obsessed with his much younger lover endlessly videotapes her every move, and then confides his surprising plans for her; in another a ghost can't stop resigning from his job. Masterfully, Marías manages in a small space to perplex and delight. "The short story fits Marías like a glove," as *Le Point *noted. His stories have been hailed as "formidably intelligent" (*The London Review of Books*), "a bracing tonic" (*The Chicago Tribune*), and "startling" (*The New York Times Book Review*).
