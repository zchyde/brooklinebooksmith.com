<br>She has been hailed by Michael Chabon as the most darkly playful voice in American fiction and by Neil Gaiman as a national treasure.

In I Can See Right Through You, a middle-aged movie star makes a disturbing trip to the Florida swamp where his former on- and off-screen love interest is shooting a ghost-hunting reality show. In The New Boyfriend, a suburban slumber party takes an unusual turn, and a teenage friendship is tested, when the spoiled birthday girl opens her big present: a life-size animated doll.

In "Get in Trouble, "this one-of-a-kind talent expands the boundaries of what short fiction can do.
